When watching something, the picture does take a minute to download, buffer, and catch up, so the first little bit may be a bit blurry, but it evens out. There is also the Roku app for your phone, and this adds some ease of use.

{"comment": "I purchased a Tripp Lite surge protector TLP128TTUSBB on July 1, 2019. It provided 4320 joules of surge protection for a loved one's pacemaker monitor. A crazy powerful lightning storm went through my neighborhood in September of 2019. The lightning strikes were so close that the thunder shook our wooden frame house! The next day, the green LED for \"Protected\" would no longer light. It never went on again. I looked through the device's manual. It clearly stated that if that LED is not lit, the surge protector is no longer providing any surge protection. The next electric surge might fry everything connected to the Tripp Lite. I took a similar Tripp Lite surge protector from my bedside (which was protecting a charger connected to my $650 Samsung Galaxy S8+) and relocated it to protect the pacemaker monitor. I quickly ordered another Tripp Lite surge protector and hoped it would arrive before the next lightning storm zapped my phone."},
{"comment": "The replacement arrived, and I forgot to file a claim with Asurion or Tripp Lite until today. It turned out that Tripp Lite, while willing to replace the surge protector if the \"Protected\" LED went out, was unwilling to shoulder the cost of shipping the non-functional device back to them. Tripp Lite would not replace the device unless the non-functional one was sent to them. I'm not mad or disappointed at Tripp Lite. After all, even with the shipping cost, I would still come out ahead (The cost of the device was $27.33, and the shipping cost would be significantly less.) I could also just drive over to their headquarters in Chicago. I live only 30 miles away."},
{"comment": "However, I remembered I had bought a protection plan. I filed the claim online. Asurion required the protection plan's \"Order Number\". I found it in the email Asurion sent me when I bought the protection plan. I answered a few other questions like when did the device stop working properly, how much did I pay for the device, what happened, etc. I finished filing the claim in less than 5 minutes. They gave me a reference number and stated that they'll reimburse me with an Amazon gift card within 3 business days. I was astonished when they sent me an email with the Amazon eGiftcard a few minutes later! I've since entered it into my account. It was for the full amount I paid for the device back in July. The whole process didn't take 10 minutes! It all worked very smoothly. I'm impressed."},
{"comment": "Let's see where this goes.  I purchased a replacement phone screen, (a non apple product), from amazon for my iPhone 6S.  The screen's bottom half quit working one day after the seller's warranty expired.  I've tried to contact the seller but I have not heard back from.  When I tried to file a claim with ASURION, I was told that my purchase, (a non apple product I remind you), may still be under warranty by the manufacturer and to please contact them."},

{"comment": "Having the ability to insure a electronic is not only awesome but a necessity to say the least. I've found that each and every time I've purchased something fragile and expensive or any electronics really all together that I've seemed to have that one big awful accident at the end of it's warranty that comes with purchase automatically...then I'm in quite a pickle everytime...this has given me the ability to avoid all that and have less worries and keep a protective backup in case I do find myself in said pickle again, haha..only this time it's only a bummer at first cause I know I'll receive the necessary help needed for literally no expense to me that broke my wallet what so ever...so as a whole do i recommend this? YES ABSOLUTELY! do yourself a favor don't think save a buck in the moment, think in the future...think accidents happen...have a backup insurance plan cause the future tends to be messy. 2 years & it's cheap..handy..simple, what else can ya ask for really...?? Absolutely five star. : )"},
{"comment": "I bought this plan because it appeared underneath an iPhone replacement screen I was buying. I bought the plan because it said that it would pay for a replacement if the electronic product stopped functioning. You can imagine my surprise when I try to file a claim and am told the plan doesn\u2019t actually cover screen damages. Why was I led to believe it would - and why did it appear as a warranty for the screen when I bought it?"},
{"comment": "My recommendation is to just read the fine print. If it\u2019s just a few dollars, make sure that you\u2019re getting the right type of warranty or protection plan and not just the one that\u2019s associated with what you\u2019re buying, especially since it might not add up in the end."},
{"comment": "I called them about a problem with my Retekess TIVDIO V-115 FM-AM-SW Multiband Radio Music Player. It was within 30 days of purchase so they transferred me to Amazon Customer Service. That was the correct way to handle it. Asurion kept the contract open to cover a replacement device. The only problem is currently Amazon does not have the 2-year contract in stock or they have dropped it. That is Amazon's problem, not Asurion's."},

It hears you almost all of the time and I've run into very few issues with it overall. I really couldn't ask for a more helpful device. It's even more handy when I found that I could get a battery base for it. The GGMM D3 base that I found lets me carry the alexa dot around pretty much anywhere. I love that I can take it into the bathroom with me and listen to music while I shower or take it outside and listen to music. That's really the only thing I think it was missing."},
{"comment": "I 've used Roku for years,including several different models.The best recent thing of note is Roku has recently released The Roku Channel,which has hundreds of free movies.It is ad supported.And now Locast.org app gives you free local broadcast stations CBS,NBC,FOX,ABC and PBS.Locast now offers local TV network broadcasts for New York,Boston,Chicago,Houston,Dallas,Denver areas and plans to add many more cities.This means many folks will no longer need antennas to watch local networks for free. Roku has just about every app you can imagine (YouTube/Pandora/Netflix/Amazon/Hulu/HBO Now) plus tons of more apps in many different categories.Roku Premiere 2018 works fine,but you need to point the remote at the device,unlike other Roku models.Here are some points to consider when deciding on which model of Roku to buy:"},
{"comment": "I had two amazon firesticks but can not find one so found a good deal on this and decided to try. It works just the same but has some extra features, I use the Ruko channel often and love it and the remote is easy to use. I would def recommend it for the value my only downfall is that I can not use the 4K Ultra unless you buy a special one and echo to go with it and that was not in the budget right now."},
{"comment": "Purchased this thinking it was a good deal. When I received it the power plug was missing and the remote was not the right one. I contacted support only to be given the run around and after all that only received a small promo credit that wasn\u2019t even enough to buy the cable much less the replacement remotes. I would not purchase amazon refurbished items."},

{"comment": "I've been a happy owner of a 2nd generation Echo and three 2nd generation Echo Dots for a year now, and I was glad to add this to the arsenal.  After using it for a few days I am generally pleased with it, but it does have limitations, especially when it comes to sound quality (no surprise there!).  I will start by summarizing what's new about the 3rd Generation Dot, then I'll describe the device in more detail, and finally I'll add some thoughts about how to choose which Echo device may be best for you."},
{"comment": "The most obvious update to the Dot is the new look: it's as if someone took a 2nd generation Dot, inflated it with an air pump, and wrapped the edge in fabric.  And it's not bad!"},
{"comment": "What's different/updated in the 3rd Generation Dot:"},
{"comment": "1) It is slightly larger than the 2nd generation device, measuring 3.9\" wide x 1.7\" tall (2nd gen was 3.3\" wide x 1.3\" tall), and the top and bottom edges are more rounded.  It is also substantially heavier at nearly twice the weight of the 2nd generation model."},
{"comment": "2) The 2nd generation Dot came in two color options (black and white), each of which had a shiny plastic exterior that I personally thought looked a little cheap.  The 3rd generation Dot has a fabric exterior which gives it a classier appearance, and it's available in three colors: heather grey, sandstone, and charcoal.  The fabric and rounded edges give the 3rd generation Dot a much softer look than its predecessor."},
{"comment": "4) The 3rd generation Dot has a larger speaker (1.6\", versus 1.1\" on the 2nd gen), which is paired with a larger driver as well.  I'll talk below about the effect this has on audio quality."},
{"comment": "5) The placement of the microphones is slightly different: while the 2nd generation had seven small far-field microphones on its top surface; the 3rd generation has four microphones."},
{"comment": "1)If you need to connect by WiFi in a room far away from your WiFi router,I would recommend the Roku Streaming Stick PLUS or Roku Ultra."},
{"comment": "2)If you have a 4K TV,I would recommend the Roku Ultra or Roku Streaming Stick PLUS.Premiere 2018 model can also play 4K content."},
{"comment": "3)To search for content using your voice,go with either the Streaming Stick,Streaming Stick PLUS or Ultra.All 3 of these models also have a remote that can control the power and volume on your TV."},
{"comment": "There is also a Roku app for Android & iPhone/iPad that lets you use your smartphone/tablet to control any Roku device and use your phone/tablet on-screen keyboard or voice for searches."},
{"comment": "4)If you want a wired ethernet connection,go with the Roku Ultra."},
{"comment": "5)If you want to connect to an old TV with RCA/Composite audio/video jacks,you will need the Express PLUS"},
{"comment": "6)The Express and Premiere 2018 models have a remote where it has to be pointed at the device,unlike the other Roku models."},

{"comment": "I purchased the \"sandstone\" version. The cloth is a polyester woven fabric made up of lighter and darker shades which gives it more visual interest than if it were just a solid, uniform gray. The neutral color blends in with nearly any decor, and the cloth gives the unit a softer look which is great for areas of your house where you don't want something that screams \"I'm a device!\""},
{"comment": "Aside from its larger size and slight convex bulge, the top of the device is nearly identical to that of the 2nd generation Dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an \"action\" button) and a multi-colored light ring around the top edge that tells you about the Echo's status.  The side of the device has an input for the power cable and a 3.5-mm output jack."},
{"comment": "One notable improvement is the shape of the power cable, which sits flatter against the wall than the 2nd generation Dot's cable (see my photo to see them side by side).

{"comment": "I did a side-by-side audio comparison of the 2nd and 3rd Generation Echo Dots, first with music (orchestral, a jazz combo, and some AC/DC) and then with a few newscasts.  Everything does sound better on the 3rd generation Dot, but to be honest, the sound is still pretty anemic.  Compared with the 2nd generation Dot, the sound is slightly fuller, not as annoyingly tinny, and has a small amount of bass presence (not much, but the 2nd generation had none).  Newscasts and other spoken texts benefit from the fuller sound as well, but the difference is more pronounced with music.  Just for fun, I also compared the 3rd generation Dot with my 2nd generation Echo, and THAT'S where I noticed a big difference.  Yes, the new Dot sounds a bit better than its predecessor, but they both sound weak compared to the full-sized Echo.  (To its credit, Amazon doesn't claim that the Dot has room-filling sound.)"},

Like the other Echo devices, though, it seems to have more difficulty detecting voices that come from below it (which happens if I talk to it while I'm on the floor playing with my daughter)."},

This is about our fourth Roku device. My only gripe about this item is the cords (HDMI and power cords are both too short. Instruction says to use the cords sent with the item. Since my HDMI input is on one side of the television and my power source (yes we have power strips) is on the other side my only option was to mount the ROKU itself in the middle of the tv on the bottom. We do have a sound bar in front of the tv, but it does not seem to interfere with the use of the remote. I would advise mounting this ROKU on something as it is very small and very light, It is about the width of two of my long slender fingers and no longer. I don't particularly like the remote as much as my old one. it is lighter and less buttons (ok button is in the middle of the cross arrows). No, the old one is not compatible with the new ROKU device. I did however put the ribbon from the old one on the new so as to make it easier to keep track of it. No problems loading my channels in after I got done mumbling about cheap short cords and got everything in place. i am a 74 year old woman so if I can do it, so can you.

In fact, part of the fun of owning an Echo device is seeing what new skills Amazon comes up with (even if many new skills are just silly or entertaining).

The flash briefing is fully customizable daily digest of news and other information which you can hear any time by asking \"What's my flash briefing?\" There is a huge list of content you can add to your briefing including news updates, weather forecasts, sports and traffic updates, and educational snippets along with many that are just humorous or entertaining. Using the Alexa phone app or your Echo account page you can select exactly what content you want in your briefing and in what order you want to hear it. For example, I configured mine with news feeds from NPR, BBC, and Reuters. I love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources."},
{"comment": "My other favorite feature, \"drop in,\" essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two Echo devices, sort of like an intercom.

You can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your Echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with ANY Echo device or only those in your own home."},
{"comment": "[Note that the drop-in feature is NOT the same thing as Alexa's hands-free calling feature. Hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and Echo devices in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from your Echo by saying your contact's name or number. Just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate. By contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established. For this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!]"},

For example, if Alexa thinks you asked to turn on a light but you really asked something else, she will repeatedly say \"In which room?\" until you say \"Alexa, stop\" and then start over.  I'm guessing this type of thing will improve over time as voice recognition software  becomes more advanced.  This is really more of an Alexa issue than a Dot issue, but it drives me nuts at times."},

{"comment": "When choosing between the Echo Dot and one of the larger Echo devices, perhaps the most important question to ask is \"How much do you plan to LISTEN to the device?\"  This question is important because one of the biggest differences between the Echo Dot and the larger Echo devices is sound quality: the 1.6\" speaker of the Dot simply cannot match the fullness and heft of the Echo or Echo Plus.  (Remember, they all run on the same Alexa software, which means they all have nearly identical skill sets!)"},
{"comment": "So, if you don't currently own an Echo device, start by thinking carefully about how you plan to use it.  Many Alexa skills fall into one of two broad categories: those that rely heavily on the speaker and those that don't.  For example, features that benefit from good sound quality include playing music/newscasts/podcasts, the drop-in feature, and hands-free calling.  (This is why I chose an Echo Plus for my kitchen - I use it every morning to listen to the news.)  If you plan to use your device largely for these type of features, you would probably appreciate the better sound of the Echo or Echo Plus."},
{"comment": "On the other hand, if plan to use the Echo mainly for \"non-listening\" purposes such as voice-controlling your smart home devices, then the sound quality isn't as important and a Dot is probably all you need.  In fact, you could even save some money by purchasing a 2nd generation Dot instead -- especially if it's not going to be in a highly visible location or you don't mind its shiny plastic look.  I have several \"single-purpose\" Dots in my house in rooms where I want to voice-control one thing, such as a lamp in the room, and 2nd generations Dots are just fine for this -- and now that their price has gone down they are a great value!"},

The 3rd Generation model has a great new look, but despite marginal improvements in the speaker, it's still pretty unsatisfying as a playback device for music or  newscasts.  As long as you are willing to accept its acoustic limitations, the Dot can be a wonderful device to have in your home.  And if you DO want better sound quality for the features you use most often, you can always connect the Dot to your own sound system via Bluetooth or the 3.5-mm audio jack.  Hope this was helpful!"},

What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them.

The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality."},

{"comment": "I really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it. The gen 3 is a bit bigger and has a much more rounded shape. While it makes it look better by itself, it lacks the ability to really customize it. It surely would not work as a power socket mount, like you could do with the gen 2, just due to the additional weight."},
{"comment": "That is before you get to the horrendous power cord and adapter. The power adapter is twice as big as the gen 2 and the power cord went away from the, easy to find, usb style cord to a old style input style and it is permanently attached to the power adapter. This is really my biggest complaint as it took away so much flexibility, that you could enjoy with the gen 2. Don't get me wrong, I am sure there will be several new cords and adapters put out to fill the gap, but that is not as easy as using cords many already have. Just makes no sense.

It looks like I'm not the only one having issues with it so learn from our mistakes and don't buy it. Not to mention you can never get in contact with anyone at gopro to get any help. I've been trying again to contact them and I can't. It's not a fun experience that's for sure."},
{"comment": "This little plate is awesome to hide a small streaming box. We just mounted our 65\u201d Samsung TV and wanted to hide everything behind the TV....this made that possible.  The only that threw us off was the directions. It only gives you directions for a vertical TV mount. We had a full Motion SANUS TV Mount (from Costco) with an \u201cX Mount Bracket\u201d, so we were alittle perplexed (we\u2019re novice at mounting TV\u2019s...actually it was our first time). Nevertheless, we figured it out and now everything looks clean and tidy. By the way, we mounted a RVEAL Box (which you can find on Amazon) to give you some perspective on what can fit on this plate....the streaming device takes up most of the space.  Also, our remote to our streaming box works without any interference."},

AND, it then gives an SD card error (SanDisk 128GB Extreme Pro Micro SDXC 275MB UHS-II Class-10 U3 4K), telling me that the ONLY WAY to fix the card is by FORMATING, which will then erase ALL data!  WTF GoPro???"},
{"comment": "I bought two of these to mount my TiVo Minis on the back of two TVs (23\" and 32\") that just had traditional tabletop stands. As other reviewers have mentioned, the Mini covers pretty much the entire plate, so you have to get a little creative with the velcro straps. Plus, using just one small screw to attach the mount to the TV means the bracket tends to not hold its position if you mount it horizontally, which I had to do to avoid it overlapping with the jacks on the back of my TVs. The weight of the Mini is just a little too much for a single screw to hold the plate in a fixed position. The velcro straps are really good, although the base (and the direction in which they twist) also make it a challenge with the TiVo Mini."},

{"comment": "The bracket attaches to just one screw of the standard VESA mount on the back of the TV. If you're using a wall mount, it slides between the TV and the mount. Your TV will be slightly skewed relative to the mount as a result, because one of the four mounting points will have the extra thickness of the bracket to deal with. It would be better if the mount attached to two of the VESA screw holes, or included a set of washers the same thickness as the bracket to even things out."},
{"comment": "I like this platform and am using it to support our Apple TV at the top of a Samsung TV. The other mount we've tried more recently (from  Apple, I believe) places the Apple TV out of sight, behind the TV (good), but in that position prevents the remote from working very well (bad). The VIVO platform lets you mount the Apple TV where it is exposed to view (don't care that much) and communicates with the remote easily (good!)."},

{"comment": "11/15/19  UPDATE:"},
{"comment": "As it turns out, for proper camera performance, you will need to update the original Hero8 camera's v00.15 software that's loaded from the factory which came with my Hero8, to the latest v1.20 to function properly (supposed to eliminate the Left to Right \"image shake\", and image Freezing/Lockup I experienced). It's a manual update that is very easy to do, and is easily downloaded from the GoPro website. If needed, simply \"online chat\" with the GoPro people and they will walk you through this required software update (which they did with me)."},

{"comment": "So, it works okay, but there's room for improvement."},
{"comment": "My TV and device for the job were a Samsung UN75H6350 75-Inch (2014 Model) and Roku 4K Ultra. A solid mounting unit overall. The system came in the box with 6 different size Philips head screws and various washers and spacers to accommodate multiple configurations. Instructions were clearly illustrated and explained in English (as in: first language English). The mounting holes on my TV (table mounted) were too wide so I could only secure the panel using a single hole, which still turned out plenty tight enough. The included hardware contained a screw (M8x20). The provided strap downs were intuitive and ratcheted down my device, super tight. The mounting design was flexible installing my Roku 4K Ultra vertically. I was doubly pleased being able to use both provided straps. No worries the ECHOGEAR will be in place for years."},
{"comment": "This was exactly what I was looking for. Exact same as the sanus baps1 sold for higher price from bby.  It is basically a thin piece of metal with strategic hooks that clip into a sanus TV mount..  I secure this with a PC case screw to lock it into place.  It is behind the TV so it really doesn't move.  Bought the official sanus one then this one, no difference.  Used two on the Sam TV mount, one to hold a firetv gen 2 and a second one to hold a 5 port network switch.  Made my TV install super clean.  The official one from bby is twenty bucks so check when this price fluctuates."},
{"comment": "I don't know why but when I first received this mount I thought it would be a plastic surface mount , a hard plastic but was surprised it was a good solid metal mount for my Roku Ultra. I may attach it to the side of my TV entertainment center which is hard wood. It will attach to the back of most any TV set. The quality of this mount is really good you could add about any type of streamer to it. And it does have more than enough circulation holes to vent heat through it for any device which is great. It's snugs nicely with each streamer bands included. Surly I think It is worth the cost I may order a few more in the coming weeks..."},
{"comment": "When I was setting the VIVO up on top of the TV, the sticky surface of the platform seemed ideal in that perhaps the bungie band provided would not be needed to hold the Apple TV in place on the platform. However, when I plugged in the HDMI, power, and ethernet cables, the weight of those at the back of the Apple TV caused it to unstick from the surface and tip up (not good). The bungie loop holds it in place."},
{"comment": "This may seem like a minor annoyance - I expect that I won't notice it after a short time - but as a fan of elegant design, the bungie loop seems like sort of a hack. I'd rather see a surface that is sticky enough to counterbalance the weight of the cables, or some kind of clamp or grip to hold the Apple TV in place more positively."},
{"comment": "I get that the bungie is a cheap and easy way to hold it down, and that other means may be patented and therefore expensive license (or defend against legally). But.... a bungie? It's highly adaptable, but  just doesn't look very good."},

They have a sticky pad to rest whatever on (I've got a soundbar up there) and the one and only issue I have is with that. It's so sticky it takes a little extra work to adjust the soundbar if I've put it up there unevenly. Wah! Big deal. I prefer it sticky so I don't worry about the soundbar falling off."},
{"comment": "Ok... \"so far, so good\", and my rating goes from 1 star to 4 stars (if Amazon will let me increase my rating).  The v1.20 software update seems to have eliminated the Left to Right \"image shake\", and image Freezing/Lockup problems I originally experienced.  I performed a full one hour recording (one full battery), and there was NO image shake, NO lockup and NO image freezing.  Seems all the Hero8 needed was this new v1.20 update and it was good to go.  GoPro could have eliminated a LOT of complaints had they shipped the Hero8 with the v1.20 update, but as I said... this latest update may not have been available at the time of first release.  Regardless, I feel the 10/31/19 release date should have been held back for a week or two until the original v00.15 could have been replaced with this new update.  In any event, all seems well & good for now... until I get more recording hours on it!!!"},
{"comment": "A lot of the reviews I see here are from previous GoPro users who are unhappy with their upgrade. I am a first-time GoPro user but come from a family of photographers and professionals. I personally can say I absolutely love the hero8. Stabilization from hypersmooth 2.0 is really near gimbal quality at this point. I've already tested the underwater aspect of the camera without a case and it performed beautifully! I've had zero issues with SD cards, freezing or really anything else. My main gripe is with the GoPro app... not a fan! but doesn't matter because I'm exporting everything to Adobe premiere pro anyways. To sum it up, for an action camera the image quality really is incredible on the GoPro Hero8 and I am perfectly pleased with my purchase I can't wait to really push the limits of this camera!"},
{"comment": "This is more like a mid cycle refresh. Most of the selling point for this camera seems like can be achieved on the 7 black through a software upgrade. I mean they brought something new to the hardware department but took vital key elements. Yes, we gained a monumental move to foldable mount feet in an effort to rid the frame. But at what cost? We lost a micro hdmi port for quick, direct viewing to your hdtv. A feature that will now be only achievable through a \"mod\" add on for $80! Then there's the battery door. It's so flimsy and easily detachable. Potentially easy to lose while changing battery on the go. Would have been better if it had a rubber tether attached to the battery door and the camera itself. Other thing I feel like  a downgrade is the non replaceable lens! I know it's advertised as 2x the strength of the previous one but now you have that lingering on your mind. I feel like there has been a lot of sacrifices to achieve one good thing. If it wasn't for the fact that I was able to sell my GoPro 7 close to what I paid for it, the TradeUp deal, and the American Express offer, I would have given this a hard pass."},
{"comment": "For the money, this camera is horrible. Not user friendly and difficult to charge.  Avoid!"},
{"comment": "I skipped Hero 7 because I got Hero 6  right before the 7 came out.  Anyways, HUGE upgrade in stabilization from my Hero 6, also audio is much better, this is the best GoPro in terms of stabilization.  If you need gimbal performance without an actual gimbal I think this is the way to go plus it fits in my pocket so I take it everywhere and make videos anywhere I want.  Low light performance is not that great, better than Hero 6 but I don't expect to use this for low light too much, it's really action camera for daylight."},
{"comment": "I have two of these that I use for either a Fire TV box or the other one I use with a Raspberry Pi Zero + accessories. The straps they come with are handy, but I found that certain items work better with zip ties (as you can see in the photos). Comes with a ton of screws and spacers. Everything you would need really. My only gripe, and its not a big one, is I wish there was more of a flush fit with the back of the TV. As it is, there is a bit of space that this thing just kind of hangs with. Not a big deal at all, just weird. The price could stand to be a bit lower, but it's very niche so I get it."},

{"comment": "Update: I'm changing my review from 5 to 4 stars after more use with this GoPro in different situations. Here's why:"},
{"comment": "- Unlike previous models, the Hero 8 only has one door to access the battery, memory card and charging port. The Hero 5-7 models had a door for the battery and memory card on the bottom and a separate door for the charging and display-out ports on the side. While I'm sure this change was made to keep manufacturing costs down and perhaps also improve waterproofing, as someone who often uses the GoPro to record lengthy time lapses this change has become a bit of a notable frustration for me. The single door on the Hero 8 is on the side, which means you can still mount it while the door is open - this is a good thing. However, since this door now also houses the battery and memory card beneath it, it's much larger and is also not removable (at least as far as I know). On my previous GoPro Hero 5/6/7 I would simply remove the charging port door, pop it into my frame mount, connect it to my powerbank and I was good to go for a long time lapse or extended shooting. If I was ever concerned about potential bad weather, I could easily fit a piece of tape over the open door area for protection. This can still be done with the new design of the singular door on the Hero 8, but is not nearly as convenient since the entire door must remain attached but open in order to connect a USB-C cable. I have also experienced issues (particularly just when trying to charge the battery inside the camera) where the battery has not made proper contact while the door is open and therefore does not charge, even though it's plugged in. This has unfortunately happened on multiple occasions and as a result I've missed being able to record certain activities/events because the battery wasn't charging. Again, this is simply a result of the battery and charge port sharing the same door. Personally I preferred the double-door design of the Hero 5-7 models and I hope they reverse or fix this design in future models."},
{"comment": "- It's nice that the Hero 8 provides several \"loadouts\" for each mode (photo/video/time lapse) - these allow you to quickly switch many settings at once to a different set. However, the loadout names are preset and cannot be changed (as far as I can tell) and you also cannot add or create new loadouts beyond the several that it provides for each mode - you can only change and edit settings for the existing loadouts. It would be much nicer if it allowed you to not only rename and customize these loadouts, but to also add and create new ones in addition to the 4 that it provides (and seems to limit you to)."},
{"comment": "Let me preface this review by saying that I've owned almost every single GoPro Hero model since the GoPro Hero 2 - with the exception of the Hero 3, I've owned each model from the Hero 2 all the way up to now this Hero 8 Black. I think the best hardware update arrived with the Hero 5 where you no longer needed a separate housing to make the camera waterproof, but the best software update is definitely the HyperSmooth 2.0 stabilization you'll find on this Hero 8 (not to mention the increased shooting modes/resolutions that have been released since). Features like TimeWarp and HyperSmooth have really changed the way GoPros can be used and makes them much more versatile than they ever have been before. Not only that but the footage is a lot more usable now with the improved stabilization, since shaky video has always been a problem that has plagued GoPro footage in my experience with older models. HyperSmooth 2.0 is a total game-changer - it's super fluid and can even look gimbal-like if you take your time with filming (footage taken from activities like mountain biking and snowboarding may not look quite gimbal-like, but compared to what this footage would look like on older GoPros, the difference in stabilization is night and day). I used to have to run pretty much all my old GoPro footage through Warp Stabilizer in After Effects, even if I was trying to be as steady as possible while filming - now I only have to use that method if, like mentioned above, the camera is mounted on something or someone very movement-heavy (mountain biking is probably the best example of this, where footage is often rough relative to the terrain)."},
{"comment": "With this being said, the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because compared to the Hero 7, aside from the improved HyperSmooth stabilization, there really aren't that many other improvements or features that make this particular model worth the price compared to the significantly lower price of the Hero 7 which has many of the same features, including TimeWarp. To put it simply, if you own a GoPro Hero 6 or older, I would say it is well worth upgrading to the Hero 8. However, if you own a Hero 7 and are wondering if it's worthwhile upgrading to the Hero 8, I would actually say it's not, unless you have about $500 burning a hole in your pocket. I think that compared to the Hero 7 Black, there aren't enough new features on the 8 to justify paying the full price unless you NEED the improved stabilization and framerates, because that's really the only difference in my experience. But like I said, if you have an older GoPro or are looking to buy a GoPro for the first time, you definitely won't be disappointed with the Hero 8!"},

{"comment": "I didn't mention anything about the audio quality on this GoPro because frankly I would never rely on or expect GoPro audio to be good. If you're buying this camera, it should be for videos and/or photos. If recording quality audio is important to you, I would suggest looking into an external microphone, or a different camera altogether. I think the audio on the 8 is likely the best GoPro audio there is, but in my experience, GoPro audio has always been pretty underwhelming (to put it nicely)."},
{"comment": "PS - GoPro batteries from the Hero 5, 6 and 7 models will all still work with the 8, as long as they are official GoPro batteries and not third-party batteries (GoPro removed support for third-party batteries through a firmware update several years ago, much to the disappointment of many GoPro owners including myself) - however, it is also important to be aware that only the new GoPro batteries (with the blue bottom) will support the use of HyperSmooth 2.0 on the Hero 8. The compatible batteries from previous GoPro models will let you use any other mode/feature but HyperSmooth 2.0 requires the new battery model in order to work properly."},
{"comment": "The camera stopped working pretty much out of the box. Checked to make sure the SD card is compatible before buying so that wasn\u2019t the issue.

It's really nice. This is how it should have been all along. It gets even better though... lets say my TV is already on, and my receiver is set to a different input such as my FIOS tv box? All you do is click the home button on the remote and the remote switches the receiver to the correct hdmi input on the receiver for the fire stick! One remote to rule them all, and yes it controls volume on the receiver too! This is excellent. It's highly configurable. The setup is quite nice. You can define which inputs get picked when hitting the power and home button. You can define which device the volume buttons control. Amazon has done a great job with the Fire Stick 4K."},
{"comment": "I purchased this camera for a recent family trip where I wanted to try this camera for some snorkeling we had planned. Unfortunately, we couldn't use the camera as the Hero 8 wouldn't format any of the GoPro recommended micro SD Cards. I purchased 8 Samsung Micro SD Cards (EVO Plus) and not one of them worked. I tried formatting on the camera itself, on a PC, Mac and Linux. GoPro has various support docs on how to do this, but unfortunately none of the recommended approaches worked. I did some 'Google searches' on this particular issue and it looks like there are other users with the same problem. For now, I do not recommend this camera but hopefully there will be a firmware update that will 'fix' this issue."},
{"comment": "Got a defective product from Amazon\u2019s Apario retail. Video recording did not work properly even a single day. Thought the issue is with memory card etc. Tried with multiple compatible ones still same result. I guess the new version is still buggy and make sense to wait for next stable release. Service from Amazon is equally awful in such cases and no accountability at all for shipping a defective product and only way out is to have an ordeal with GoPro service center. Imagine the pain of customer who spend such big amount only to go to service center having been shipped an item that did not work properly from day one. These are some of the nuisance of online shopping of expansive items. No matter how much premium you pay to choose top retailer for quality product or service. Pretty disappointing experience.

Quick capture often fails because of it. There is a slow off/on process (sometimes turning it off is dreadful!).

{"comment": "It's faster than previous fire sticks. No more menu lag. Things are smoother and faster overall. I've used Roku, Chromecast Ultra and Fire Stick... I like them all for different reasons. I also dislike chromecast because 5.1 audio will not work on my receiver because chromecast refuses to support Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1. Fire stick has no problem handling DD5.1. This makes my plex and netflix experience much more enjoyable. The remote is better than not having a remote (chromecast). Roku's are very nice as well. All 3 of these options are great in their own way and frankly I had thought fire stick was the least desirable but recently I've come to realize I prefer Fire stick so I pre-ordered the 4K fire stick and I could not be happier with it. Amazon needs to keep up the good work. The 4K stick is a solid product and an excellent upgrade from the previous model"},

{"comment": "1) The Amazon platform is basically retooled Android, which is a crap interface. It\u2019s cluttered, redundant, and Amazon being Amazon wants you to use all their services over everyone else\u2019s so not only does their menu get in the way but the top third of the home screen is promotions for whatever they want to push."},
{"comment": "2) Also because it\u2019s Amazon they want you to use THEIR streaming services to rent movies so much so that there is no Vudu or Google Play app available to install. If Prime Video had a decent selection of rentals (it doesn\u2019t) or a halfway usable interface (it doesn\u2019t) I would have less of a problem."},
{"comment": "3) Our FireTV Stick has issues with flickering and sound dropout. Tech support immediately supplied a series of less than helpful troubleshooting tips. \u201cDid you try a different TV? Did you try a different HDMI port?\u201d Despite my Roku working just fine. I elected to return this since I was already fed up with the closed interface and terrible menus."},
{"comment": "Slightly less of an issue but still annoying is the inability to completely turn off HDR. Its either \u201calways on\u201d or \u201cadaptive\u201d meaning the content dictates HDR which is a problem especially with Netflix (which is calibrated too dark on some TVs)"},

{"comment": "Under ideal sunny conditions it works great, but I find that any type of dynamic changes in the lighting conditions -- going through tunnels, cloudy days, or moving from sunny to shady or indoors to outdoors and vice versa -- is pretty disappointing. Accessories cheap and overpriced. Battery door not thought through, annoying to remove the memory card. Battery life is pretty poor, and so taking long timelapses requires external power through USB which can be annoying with the battery and door design. Pretty easy for the battery to fall out."},

{"comment": "To be honest I was expecting a better picture quality from this and wasn't overly impressed.

{"comment": "However my issue with not having a way to watch VUDU/UV movies is a huge issue. On top is that, MoviesAnywhere doesn\u2019t tell you which movies were transferred over in 4K. So while the titles may sync, in cases of certain films (eg Deadpool 2) you only get the HD version and not the UHD/HDR one you paid for. Until this is fixed I\u2019ll leave my review at 3 stars."},
{"comment": "Our main streaming service is DirecTV Now, and this stick doesn't run it right. The app seems to works and then just freezes. When I go to run a speed test, the connection is super low, and then ramps up over time back up to full speed. It's as though the app crashes the stick.  Other things seem to work fine, but not the app we use the most.  Will return and continue to use gen 2 and gen 3 devices. Too bad."},
{"comment": "UPDATE: So, I deleted DirecTV Now and did a fresh install. For the past three days, things actually worked well and considered revising my rating. Then I tried to watch a little Sunday football. CBS froze over and over again and caused the app to continually crash. Thought maybe it was the local CBS stream because other channels worked fine. Then I tried the Roku I have in my kids room, DirecTV Now worked fine. Figured I'd give it another go for the second game, same result. Watched Rams/Seahawks in my kids room with no issue on the Roku device. Again, other apps seem to work fine (I think) on Fire, but this stick isn't right just yet. I'd wait for problems to work itself out."},

This company seems to have a bunch of listings. One of them is for the Amazon Fire Stick and this one is for the Fire Stick, Chromecast, etc. THIS CONVERTER WORKS PERFECTLY FOR THE AMAZON FIRE STREAMING STICK.

I am using it with my old TV that doesn\u2019t have HDMI and it works perfectly."},

All-in-all, I\u2019m thrilled with my purchase."},
{"comment": "I received an Amazon Fire Streaming Stick as a gift from my brother. Unfortunately, my TV doesn\u2019t have HDMI. I didn\u2019t want to tell him that I couldn\u2019t use it, and I really DID want to use it, so I searched online. I found a lot of converters that supposedly worked for the Amazon Streaming Stick. I tried several, including some cheaper ones I found. They did NOT work. This Bleiden converter worked great with my Fire Stick! The instructions were easy to follow. There is a YouTube installation video was crystal clear and easy to follow. It took about 5 minutes to get this up and running. I HIGHLY recommend this little converter if you have an Amazon Stick and want to convert HDMI into a signal that your old TV can receive."},
{"comment": "Even though I am using the Fire Stick 4K, the resolution is dialed down to 720p because there's no point in pushing the higher resolution.  The converter works fine with 1080p as well but considering my CRT is 480p, I'd rather not push the Fire Stick with no gains and push the adapter to have to downscale the additional pixels.  It may be presumptuous of me to think that lower settings means less heat generated equals longer life, but again there's no perceived benefit otherwise."},
{"comment": "Just plug n' play.  Just match the connector to their correct socket and match the RCA colors.  I used a zip tie to hold the box on the wire itself since it's pretty lightweight.  Works straight out of the box.  I did change a few settings on the Fire Stick like screen positioning, which left a small black bar at the left, however this is a limitation of the settings provided by the Fire Stick and not the converter's fault."},
{"comment": "This is RCA so don't expect HD quality on your CRT.  That said, the picture is pretty clear and would fall between Cable TV quality to DVD quality.  There are cheaper converters out there but I got burned on the first cheaper one I bought that had decent reviews.  This time I didn't want to go through that again and got this one."},

There is also a video on YouTube that has detailed install instructions if you need additional install support."},

I did the usual troubleshooting, panicking a bit since I needed it for an event in a couple of days. I reached out the the Bleiden technical support. They responded quickly with the typical troubleshooting steps most of which I had already tried. After trying the new ideas, I replied that it was still not working. In parallel I ordered two competing products from Amazon. Bleiden got back to me stating that I probably should return the product. But then in a few hours they replied again suggesting that I go through the Fire set-up and turn off Dolby. Magic! It worked. What I appreciate the most is that the technical team in California did not give up in solving my issue."},

Converter works great though, Easy to install. it isnt like HD quality picture, but it's absolutely 100% good and sound works great, everything is great. it does make the picture fit into a square in the middle of the tv, instead of being full screen.

{"comment": "In my quest to cut the cable I've been through ChromeCasts, FireSticks and now the Roku Streaming Stick Plus. To be clear, I am still rocking the firestick on one TV, but in continued in depth usage while admitting it's a little apples and oranges (since streaming stick plus is for 4k and up, and firestick is pretty standard) I find more apps that I want to use on the roku, than I do the firestick. I think this is primarily because Amazon is trying to get you to buy more stuff (not that that's a bad thing) but their stuff is more or less front and center, and Roku doesn't care: You want Hulu and YouTube to always appear first? Great! Here you go!"},
{"comment": "I find the remote to be responsive and it's actually been a boon to our babysitters as the millennials are inherently more familiar and comfortable with app culture than they are with cable. So as long as we highlight what we have, we've had no complaints. And in pairing this with a mesh network like Google Wifi, it just screams. I've had absolutely no lag issues, and bonus, I've now got Sling TV on every Television in the house, no real cable box to speak of. So I think this is a really solid little device to the point where I can't see why anyone is still paying for cable (we're doing this 30 day experiment and then I'm never coming back; I'll drop my cable equipment on my ISP's doorstep like an unwanted child and they'll hear my tires as I scream away into the night (queue maniacal laughter))."},

I currently am using YouTube TV and it works perfectly with all my Roku devices.  No more bulky cable boxes that never worked properly, and by the way saving $100.00 a month isn\u2019t so bad either!!!"},
{"comment": "The Roku Streaming Stick+ is fantastic. I'm surprised I didn't get one sooner. I am a loyal Chromecast user, and that's a fine device for sharing your Chrome browser contents on the TV, or playing a YouTube or Google Music playlist. But it lacks the ability to stream on its own. Roku has the edge by providing a stand-alone streaming device, paired with a simple, physical remote control, and the ability to download apps and channels. You can install the major apps like HBO Go, FX Now, NBC Sports Gold, YouTube, Amazon Video and Netflix. But you also get some wild Roku exclusives like B-Movie TV (movies so bad they're good - a great channel for horror and sleaze fans). If you only have room to add one streaming player, and you're deciding between a Chromecast, a Roku or an Apple TV, the choice can be made fairly simply. The Apple TV is for those who are committed to the Apple platform. If you get your music and movies from Apple, then stick with Apple. But if your choice is between a Chromecast and a Roku, go with the Roku. It can do more. The Stick+ has newer Wi-Fi compatibility for superior speed and streaming stability. And the physical remote control is just better than using your phone or laptop as the controller. And you can \"cast\" YouTube videos to it using a Chrome browser. And starting in November 2018, you can link it to the 'Google Home' app, and manage it via the Home app, or via voice commands through Google Assistant."},
{"comment": "The Stick+ is the one to get for a few reasons. First, the Wi-Fi antenna and compatibility (802.11ac) is the best Roku makes at the moment.  Second, the stick can plug into your HDMI receiver or directly into a TV HDMI port (and that method will control the volume of the TV if you have a newer model with HDMI control). And third, the remote control connects via bluetooth, so there's no need to set up any line-of-sight between the remote and the stick. The Stick+ runs a little hot, but that's OK so long as it's in a cool spot. Simply get the Amazon Basics HDMI extension cable, and the stick will keep cool away from your other heat-generating devices. Roku has always been the best value in streaming players. And now it provides more HD content, with a faster network connection, in a tiny form factor."},
{"comment": "Ok so... I purchased this thinking it would be necessary but no.... the Roku comes with its own sticky tape strip so you can stick it to the top of the tv or wherever. The tv I\u2019m using with the Roku does not have completely flat back so sticking this mount on it wasn\u2019t really going to work all to well"},
{"comment": "We bought this item in November of 2018 and installed it the same month.  We paid $12.99.  Set up was straight forward and while it held it was great.  It lost its adhesion in late January of 2019 - roughly two months after installation.  We eventually had to use Velcro tape to secure this mount to our 65\" Sharp television.  To be fair the back side of our television has a slight curve to it and I assume this is likely true of many modern sets.  It's a handy device and if it had stayed in place I would be giving it five stars instead of three."},
{"comment": "I like the product, it does exactly what it says it can do. I took one star off because the vertical in the back is not adjustable up and down. I was only able to stick about 1/3 of the adhesive part on to a flat spot. If the vertical piece had been adjustable the whole thing would be much more stable. But, as it works fine, was delivered just fine, I have to give it a thumbs up."},
{"comment": "I love these, as long as you have a flat spot on the back of your TV you can mount these! Doesn't matter if it is on the top of the TV or bottom works great even on the sides. I haven't tried this but I bet it will work attached to a sound bar even if it is mounted above or below the TV! And you can mount the ROKU right side up or upside down makes no difference only way you can tell is where the blue ON light on the ROKU is! I have ordered 6 of these and have been super happy with 5, the last one I ordered had no adhesive pad attached to the mount so I am exchanging it.  Over all I still have to give it 5 STARS cause having worked in manufacturing you sometimes get a reject that get missed but out of the other five, one has been mounted for a year and it still is holding on with no problem just make sure you clean the area where your going to put it good. They need to put in the package one of those small Alcohol wipes to clean the area where your going to attach it!!!!"},
{"comment": "So I bought this to mount my Roku and while the quality seems very good, but there's a major design flaw.  The size to mount the Roku above the edge of the TV is not tall enough for me to adhere the 3M tape to the back of the TV.  If I mounted it on the flat panel where it will stick flush, the Roku Mount is behind the TV.  If it had hooks or an adjustable \"neck\" that'd be great."},
{"comment": "I'm using the sticky pad that came with the Roku Premier and it's just fine."},

This was super simple to install, it holds the Roku perfectly and was a great price. I haven't had any problem with this staying in place or holding my Roku, it just works exactly as I want it to. Highly recommended for those who want to neatly store their Roku in a place where it's easy to access and out of the way. Just note this is not for the larger square shaped Roku devices, it's for the smaller, rectangular Roku Express or similar. It's perfect for our device!"},
{"comment": "The only thing that could have made this product better, would be a hinge on the area that attaches to the TV with adhesive. I have rounded edges on three sides (which would place the Roku at a 45-60\u00b0 angle facing downward) with a straight edge along the bottom, which was ultimately where I placed it. If I move the TV in the future though, the lower placement might not be high enough, which is why I gave it 4/5 stars. Ultimately a great product, but check out the back of your TV before you buy!"},

{"comment": "Although there are already 9,000 plus reviews and no one will ever read this, I think it's worth noting how easy it is to setup the remote to power on not only the television but accessories as well.  Remember those code books from days gone by where you had to enter a number of codes to get a remote to work with a receiver, or a sound bar?  This thing does the work for you.  It EASILY sets up to work both my TV and my SOUND BAR.  The fact that my TV is one brand and my sound bar is another is no problem.  I love not having to fish for 3 different remote controls whenever I want to watch Amazon Prime or Netflix."},

{"comment": "High speed internet, wi-fi, etc., did not get to my neck of the woods until very recently so my experience with these devices was limited.  The first was chrome cast which was good except I had to bring the laptop into the living room (I don't care to watch on a small screen) to be able to cast to the TV.  I know, a not a real big problem, but still awkward.  Also, it was a bit tricky for me to set up.  I finally took the plunge and purchased the fire stick.  I  have read some reviews that are quite technical and way above my pay grade.  I will keep this simple.  The fire stick has been very, very, good for me.  Set up was a snap.  I don't have a smart TV,  just a fairly new, cheap, HD.  The picture is great and so is the sound.  If there are technical glitches I haven't noticed them.  I still need practice negotiating the screens, but that will come with time.  I am getting used to talking to a machine, but still say \"please\" when addressing Alexa.  I have already spent a couple of snow days catching up on two seasons of \"The Blacklist\"  and have almost gotten through  \"Bosch \".  I still haven't had time for the movies.  There  is so much available it boggles the mind.  I guess all of this identifies me as an old person.  Well, I certainly am and for me the fire stick is the best thing to come along since the VCR.  I would highly recommend it for my fellow oldies who may be a bit leery about trying something out of their comfort zone."},
{"comment": "This isn't a review, but it is more of a statement... I just got my firestick a week ago and so far I am so unhappy with it. the setup and everything went fine it's just that on many of the movies I choose I have audio but no video, another issue is many of the basic channels that I thought were basic like lifetime and CBS and certain other ones I have to pay for to see. I thought they were many more free channels. Another thing, is the buffering. Most everything that I have tried to watch just keeps buffering and I can watch the same movie on my phone or my tablet which is the same Wi-Fi connection that I use for my TV and I can watch the whole movie before I can see anything on my TV. I'm about to send this back I don't understand what the big deal is with this item. and I tried to get local channels I can only get one local channel and then I can't even see it live. It just shows me what the latest headlines were on that news show. Please tell me something I don't know or that it will get better somehow."},
{"comment": "I dislike the fact that I had to pry the remote open with a pair of my scissors. I wish there was a simpler way to open it. Maybe I did not possess the strength to push it open. Also my firestick restarts itself randomly. Support helped me and I thought it fixed it but it did not. It's overheating!! I've had these issues before but not straight out the box. Really upsetting."},
{"comment": "We owned the initial firestick and had used it regularly for years.  A remote issue forced us to replace the unit, and I'm so glad we did!  The responsiveness and speed of the new version is amazing!  No more lagging or double click.  The new remote is also a huge upgrade with the voice control option.  It's a must have!"},
{"comment": "Out of the box I was disappointed with the remote. I couldn't get it opened to insert the batteries. Finally my husband used a screwdriver and forced it open. Meanwhile I had gotten onto Chat  for support and they had pretty quickly agreed to send me a  replacement, which would have arrived in three or four days. So I had to get on chat support again to get them to cancel the replacement. That was quick and easy. But if you have difficulty getting the battery compartment open, just use more force, and insert a small screwdriver to get it open. It's not as delicate as it seems at first.  Support was excellent."},
{"comment": "But I'm disappointed in the way the remote works. I would compare e it to a walkie talkie, not so much an Alexa device. You have to press a button in order to talk to the remote. So you have to have the remote in your hand in order to control the tv and turn it on/off."},
{"comment": "Our setup is that we have cable on just the living room tv. I got the Firestick for a second tv in a bedroom. And that second tv now is preferable to the livingroom tv. The remote makes it much easier to navigate. But the Alexa function is clumsy. I don't feel comfortable with the walkie talkie function, and Alexa isn't really smooth, though I suppose it will improve. Suggestions for use do pop up on screen.  So there's a learning curve for me, and I suppose for the Alexa system.  I do like the remote and the way it controls the screen content. But the Alexa interface isn't so satisfactory."},
{"comment": "I have several Alexa devices scattered around the house, so I'm familiar with the interface, and like it, and am addicted to it. But I just don't like the way Alexa works in this application. Or more accurately, I don't like the button. And in a setting where you have several people watching, only the person with the remote controls the tv, just as with an older remote system. And the remote is very small, and easily lost, so beware."},

{"comment": "$50 failure on my part was to trust the 3M mounting tape provided. I chose to use the provided mounting tape instead of making screw holes on the wall. In a short amount of time the hold fell, while the controller was in the bracket, and damaged the round buttons (both) permanently. The center sticks on the controller fit nicely into the round groves provided by the metal holder. When both the holder and controller fell off the wall to the floor, the weight of the metal damaged the controller by bending the plastic and snapping the spring. I immediately took the other off the wall and stopped using them.  So frustrating the instructions tell you to use the 3M tape and it did not stick."},

The Roku Ultra has been FANTASTIC beyond my expectations!  Totally compatible with BOTH TVs and offers 4k picture quality and 1080 picture quality on our Tvs respectively.

All KINDS of channels for outdoor lovers, muscle car lovers, even channels with videos of the ocean and woods to help you relax."},
{"comment": "Bird watching channel, it's so cool.  The remote that comes with the Ultra is capable of controlling the on/off and volume on the TV so I don't have to use the remote for the TV itself at all--EVER!!  SOOOO COOL!  Remote also has voice control which allows you to speak and tell it what you want to search for and watch, AND a button you can push on the box to find the remote should you misplace it. It's pretty loud so you will have no problem locating your remote.  One thing to add: LIVE TV options are pretty much non -existent , so, I added Sling TV  for the channels we most watch and HULU is a MUST if you want to watch ENTIRE seasons of Married With Children, MASH, Law & Order SVU, Seinfeld, and many more.  I just love this thing.  As long as your internet connection is sound, you'll really like it.  Even if I didn't have Sling or Hulu, there are 1000s of things to watch, albeit, most of them are horror channels and older movies, but, I have found some really good stuff searching through the channels.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to cut the cord.  OH, Fox news is free for rebroadcast (not live, but still today's news) as is live QVC and Weather Nation is free too.  Can't say enough good things about my Roku--so far--so good.  Bought one for the other TV and may add a third Tv.  Yep, it's the best thing since Alexa!"},
{"comment": "Works exactly as advertised and no problem using the remote with the Roku mounted on the back\u2014it operates as if Roku was in plain sight. I chose not to use the sticky tape to mount it to the back of my television, instead opting to refashion a large paper clip to hang it from one of the air vents on the back of the TV to the top wall mounting screw hole on the ultra mount. I am glad I purchased this product along with the Roku."},

{"comment": "The Roku HD that I had for my children's playroom was no longer going to support some channels so I had to upgrade;  decided on getting the Roku Ultra to keep it for a few years.  The Roku HD that I had was mounted on the back of the TV with some 3M double sided tape so I wanted something similar.  This Roku mount was a much better option than the double sided tape that I had for the Roku HD.  The mount is far more stable, the double sided tape is designed for the mount and best of all I can easily \"remove\" the Roku if I want to add a USB or MicroSD card in the future.  The mount does come with some screws and indicates that you can mount to the back of your TV with the screws but I have found that the adhesive is more than adequate.  Overall I am extremely pleased with the purchase and would get another if needed."},

{"comment": "However, only giving it 4 stars because while it does indeed hold my 80\", after installing it it's nearly impossible to remove without pre-modifying the lock-release straps.  The length of the straps are adjustable to help with this problem, but unfortunately they don't extent quite enough for my TV."},

{"comment": "My only complaint would be there is no safety on either side of the mount.  If you were to slide the TV too far to the right or left, it technically could fall off.  However, i do not see this really being an issue unless your TV is prone to constantly being bumped into."},

{"comment": "Super happy with this TV mount.  We got a 60\" LG and didn't want to deal with mounting it ourselves so we also got Installation through Amazon.  The guys that came out were great and had no problem with this mount.  The only thing they pointed out to me was that with large rooms, a mount that tilts may actually be better because you may need to tilt it downward slightly to compensate for the fact that the people sitting on the couch are lower than the TV and the viewing experience may be better if the TV is angled slightly downward.  We haven't had any problems seeing the TV, but I can see this might be an important point for others.  Our couch is also kind of high so if your living room seating is very low you may want to consider the model that tilts."},

{"comment": "Sanus is awful.  I called the company to make sure this was compatible with my new samsung 7100 series. They said it was -- it is not, screws too short. I wanted to make sure there was a horizontal adjustment after installing and they assured me there was -- there is not. I wanted to make sure the cables would lever the TV off the walls for access to cables -- they assured me it would do that -- it does not, it's merely a safety latch. In other words, the sanus support person knows absolutely nothing about their product.  Chose a different manufacturer. This one is going back."},
{"comment": "Though I miss the articulating mount option, our new Samsung 8 series TV is so slim it really needs to be flat to the wall to appreciate its slenderness."},
{"comment": "Pro: I like this mount because the bracket is not tall- the outlet and cable for TV are behind it.  This mounting bracket was one of few that could mount just above the outlets and allow for the TV to be at eye level.  The locking mechanisms-released by the adjustable webbing make for easy removal and hanging.  The mount is quite close to the wall.  The specs appear spot on"},
{"comment": "Con:  2 problems... The locking clips do not lock tight at all, they leave a 1/4\" wiggle front to back.  It would be nice if the spring-loaded clips actually grasped the mount they were obviously shaped for.  The other problem is a product of the first.  Since the clips don't tightly engage the wall mount unit the TV very easily slides left to right."},
{"comment": "If Sanus could adjust the tolerance of the spring loaded clips and add a soft rubber to them they would engage the wall plate and eliminate the movement that others have also mentioned as an issue."},
{"comment": "Overall, I wouldn't go through the trouble of returning but faced with the choice again and knowing the faults, I would have just bought the sub-$20 generic model.  Don't waste money on a brand name."},
{"comment": "Even though I purchased the correct mount for my television (I had confirmed via the manufacturer's web site), the correct size screws were not included (there were a dozen sizes included).  We should have telephoned the extremely helpful customer service sooner rather than later.  They quickly relayed the exact size screws needed and we made it to our local hardware store just before closing so that installation could continue.  A bit disappointing but not a deal breaker.  After we got the proper screws the installation was completed in less than 15 minutes.  The sliding feature was extremely helpful as existing stud location used for mounting the device did not dictate the tv placement."},

{"comment": "I put in batteries,  nothing happened. Next, we looked into the user guide for instructions on how to pair the remote, no info. Last, we googled internet and found out, you just need to press any button on the remote a few time, and the remote will pair by itself. Even the pairing is automatic I wish there is better documentation. Otherwise, it's very confusing to the user whether it's connecting or not. Anyway, the remote got paired to the FireTV stick, it seems working just like the original remote except for controlling the Power and volume, which is the main reason to have this new remote. It doesn't work with our TV, which is also we got new in this year. When pressing the Power button the TV became dark, but it didn't actually shut off the TV, it's just like in the sleep mode for pc. For the volume buttons it simply does not have single response when pressing them. Again, there is no instructions for how to use and troubleshoot, and no technical support or anything. You have no way to know if you did something wrong or it's just incompatible with our TV, even though we noticed on our Amazon profile it had already recognized and recorded our TV brand, which indicates there is some info exchanged correctly..."},

Then when I finally got it working it stopped after about 5 minutes. No power to the remote at all. And I replace the batteries three different times and the same result. It seems like the only time that it will work is when I completely unplug and plug back in my box, and it will only work for a few minutes while I am actively using it."},
{"comment": "1)  Make sure you really take the time to do research and due-diligence on cord-cutting.  Just google \"cord cutting\" to get started with several good articles.  I'm seeing a lot of 1 and 2 star reviewers who seemed surprised that they actually have to pay for things like Netflix, Hulu, etc.  Fire TV (and all of the other streaming services like Roku, Apple TV, etc.) do not just give you free access to all content.  They allow you to pick and choose what you want to watch and pay for as opposed to making you pay a big fee for a huge amount of channels you will never watch.  If you do it right, you'll have access to the content you want for a substantial savings over what you were paying with cable."},
{"comment": "2) Make sure you have a strong (and fast) internet connection.  This is very important.  We dumped our cable company in its entirety (including internet service) and upgraded to a faster dedicated line internet service with another company.  We have up to six devices simultaneously streaming at any given time in our house and our internet service can handle all of that as well as the streaming Fire TV.  So make sure yours can as well.  If you're not sure, call your internet service provider, tell them you are planning to switch to streaming television and ask them about your current speeds."},
{"comment": "3)  Some apps require a cable subscription.  You can purchase a streaming service like Sling which will bundle several of the channels you likely want but you may find yourself unable to access certain apps.  For now password sharing with one of your friends may solve that problem but I suspect its only a matter of time before that loophole gets closed.  So do your research and make sure you can access the channels you want."},
{"comment": "Ive purchased a couple of these because theyre so well priced and well built. I use it on my 75\u201d Q70r, it fits great. But i think for certain panels, you\u2019ll have an extremely hard time removing the panel off the wall. The release straps are not long enough. I needed the spacers so the ac plug doesnt jam onto the panel (depends on your setup).  Also, for my specific panel, it i can only use the last 2 holes on the mount. The tv is too big.  I honestly the size range needs to be re evaluated."},

{"comment": "The remote works perfectly for my setup - Vizio TV, Vizio soundbar, and FireTV Ultra 4K Pendant.  I don't have cable nor an AV receiver, so it is about as simple as you can get.  I have the soundbar plugged into the HDMI ARC so the TV itself controls the volume."},
{"comment": "In that configuration, the mute and volume controls control the TV volume, which in turn controls the soundbar volume.  If you have the same kind of setup,  once you have paired the remote with the TV, you are all done.  In fact, pairing with the soundbar will NOT work and will remove your ability to control the volume."},
{"comment": "The setup directions are very sparse because it is supposed to be self-guided by software once you pair to your FireTV.  However, if you make a mistake ( I did by accidentally choosing the wrong TV brand) and don't get your TV choice done, there is no way, at least no obvious way in the guided setup, to re-choose your TV.  So you end up with what you think is a 'bricked' remote."},
{"comment": "Take heart, there is help, albeit obscure.  You just need to go online to Amazon's Help section, for Amazon Devices, then choose the new remote.  It's at this link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G47P2QLV6DKLKA6P"},
{"comment": "In the help section you will see how you can go to the Settings of your FireTV device and choose Equipment Control which will let you manage your equipment setup.  What was really frustrating is, if Amazon had just added an extra section on the fold up directions, they could have put those helpful tips right in the box.  Instead, the entire back of the directions were taken up with useless disclaimers and legalese.  So the remote is very slick once paired, but the directions, if you make a mistake, are not worth the paper they are printed on.  I do have to say, that the online help is really excellent AND it includes a video.  Why they didn't put something more helpful in the directions, something as simple as \"If you have any trouble, visit the HELP section on Amazon.com\", is beyond me."},
{"comment": "4)  Give yourself time to adjust to the new interface.  It took some getting used to when I lost my ability to surf the cable channel guide.  But the fact is, I'm no longer wasting large chunks of time mindlessly surfing the guide.  Rather than surf, I'm turning to specific apps to watch specific programs.  Its liberating in a way that I didn't expect.  Besides, I can now surf all of the Amazon Prime content by simply using the voice command on the remote."},
{"comment": "This review is more of a guide for cablecutters, which we have found fire TV a great way to accomplish this. There's plenty of reviews explaining how to use the fire, so this is more for people like us who don't want to pay full cable prices but are ok with paying for access to apps to still watch all our cable shows, at a significant savings to cable, and are used to using a dvr (we used tivo) and don't want to watch commercials. We've had this box for a couple weeks now, and while it has taken some getting used to, since you have to access your shows through individual apps instead of them all being on one big list, we have found it worthwhile to make the switch."},
{"comment": "Keep in mind you have to be able to plug an hdmi cord into your tv. We actually had to buy a new tv to be able to use this box but tvs are so cheap nowadays that it was still cheaper to buy a new one than to keep up with our cable bill. The savings in just the first several of months covered the cost of the tv. The interface on the fire tv is really easy to use and navigate through all the apps you wish to use and everything is kept nice and organized. We got the box instead of the stick because we wanted to have a more reliable, faster wired connection to our internet. At first I was sad to read on other reviews that the voice control doesn't work on any of the apps, but honestly I've never even used it once since getting it and once you sign into everything, there's not much need of typing to find your shows on other apps so I really don't miss it at all. If you just want this to watch prime tv included in your amazon subscription then you can stop here, the rest is about what apps we use (and pay for) to watch our shows. I will list what apps we have found useful and what we found we could do without."},
{"comment": "I did the math before purchasing this, and even after paying the monthly subscriptions for ALL the apps we'd need to watch our favorite shows, we'd still be saving around $1000 per year! And now after using this for a couple weeks, it will be even more of a savings than I thought because we don't need to pay for Sling tv. The channels we'd mostly watch from sling have their own apps (A&E and History) where you can watch their shows for free with little to no commercials at all. On the Sling tv app you are forced to watch commercials, it has no fast forwarding or recording. We tried watching one show and there was 12 commercials in one of 4 or 5 commercial breaks. After using tivo for so many years, we couldn't handle it. So now, here are the apps we DO pay for and find useful:"},
{"comment": "1. Playstation vue. (note: you do *not* need a playstation to sign up for this. I do not own one. I made my account from my computer on their website) This one is by far the most expensive monthly fee, but for us it is totally worth it for the amount of channels, content and recording capability. has a lot of our favorite channels. AMC, discovery, fox, tlc, spike, fx, nbc, bravo, the food network, just to name a few! This is by far our most used app, and you cannot get it on other devices, like a roku, which is one of the reasons why we went with the fireTV. And it was certainly the right decision for us. Once you get it set up and add your \"favorite\" shows, it will act as it's own dvr and records and saves your shows for 30 days after they air. Most channels you can fast forward through commercials, except for a few. Like abc, and fox. If you want to watch such channels without commercials you can do as we did and also subscribe to:"},
{"comment": "2. Hulu. Commercial free plan is great, though some shows will still have 1 commercial at the beginning and the end, but I find that acceptable.

Good news for roku owners though!"},
{"comment": "Recently we decided to \"cut the cord\" and cancel our cable subscription.  We already had a Fire Stick and were happy with it, but we needed another so we'd have one in our bedroom and one in the living room.  I was about to order another Stick, but after talking to a co-worker, he convinced me that since this would now be our main source of entertainment, it'd probably be worth spending a little more to get a better set up.  Excellent advice!"},
{"comment": "I loved our old Fire Stick, but it would regularly lag and take a few seconds to respond when we'd scroll over or click on something.  I could be wrong, but I think it was a 2nd generation one.  It did everything we needed, but it's very annoying to hit a button and not see anything happen for a few seconds.  Half the time I would hit the button again and when the system would respond, I'd of scrolled past what I wanted."},
{"comment": "Anyway, when this baby arrived, I set it up with an Ethernet connection (also a big plus over the Stick) and had it going within a minute or two.  Set us is wonderfully simple.  Right away I started downloading all the apps I wanted and it was at this time that I knew we were right to spend the extra money.  There is virtually no lag time when you're using this system.  Sometimes we have to wait on the internet connection, but those delays are not because of the Fire TV.  The system itself is fast!"},

{"comment": "However, with its price and acceptable quality, and more functionality, I still feel it's a good buy."},
{"comment": "I've been using this for about a week and I simply love it.  It's actually a little smaller than I expected (a good thing for me).  The clip is spring loaded and is pretty strong so it stays where you put it, even when jogging or working out.  I bought this mainly to replace an older player because I wanted wireless bluetooth technology and the built in clip .  It also can be physically wired to your speaker/headset through a standard 3.5mm cable/connector, which is included in the box.  I bought the 8 gig memory version which is plenty for me, but you can add a memory card for even more storage (but I have not used that yet).  I really like that it has a separate on/off switch on the side of the device cause I really don't like those devices where you have to long press a button to turn it on and off.  The volume is controlled by another rocker switch on the other side of the unit.  As for functionality, I use only WMA formatted music and it plays these just great with nice rich sound at both the low end and high ends.  I used the enclosed USB cable to connect to my laptop and downloaded about 6 gig of music very easily.  When plugged into a Windows laptop, this device just appears as another file system folder so you can just drag your music folders onto this device.  It has a variety of ways to play your music and I primarily use the \"shuffle\" mode or create individual playlists.  It also has a built in FM radio and the ability to set up 10 pre-set radio stations.  I get pretty good reception on most of my favorite local FM stations.  It is supposed to be able to play \"ebooks\", but I have not tried this yet, so cannot comment.  It takes a little time to get used to scrolling through the menu and setup options, but is pretty intuitive once you get the hang of it (of course, I never read the instruction manual either).  The device is charged through a micro USB connector and  the initial full charge has lasted for the entire week, so battery life seems good so far.  As far as bluetooth, it is pretty easy to pair to my bluetooth headphones, but so far it seems like you have to go through the setup menus to initiate the pairing process every time you turn the device on, but maybe I'm doing something wrong.  Once paired, it seems to stay connected pretty well and I get about 30 feet of wireless range.  Overall, I really like this little player."},

Downside is that when you hit the rewind button, the mp3 player goes back to the previous song instead of the beginning of the one you were listening to.  I also wish that you could turn up/down the volume without having to have the volume number stay on the screen so long. You have to press a button to make it go away.  All in all this is a fantastic product.  I recommend getting their warranty with it.  It even covers the headphones.  Kingtop (Amazon Marketplace) are full of friendly, kind and professional individuals.  When my headphones got damaged, they sent me a free pair to replace them.  Definitely worth the buy."},

It found channels my TV never did. On the other hand, the far away bay area channels it is not finding when my TV does. There's no option to manually tune to them. That needs to be added.  The program guide has a nice layout. No search option though. That needs to be added. The guide is limited to a week or less so if a program you want to set up recording for you'll have to wait for the guide to get to it if it isn't within the narrow range.  So that needs to be extended.  There's no program guide on the app so if you want to set a recording you have to wait for the program to actuality start. Even then, there's no option to record the series. I've experienced multiple error messages when connecting outside the house. I've tried connecting through my home vpn thinking that my router was refusing the port, but that doesn't help. If it doesn't want to connect, it won't. It's just a bug in their end that needs to be worked out. I still haven't figured out what order recordings are sorted in on the app so finding the most recent is difficult. They are dated, but their is no times so if it is a new recording or something like that, good luck.  There is no option to delete recordings from the app."},

Came in perfect condition and I was so excited it did, as well as stickers to put on your eribong or however you'd like to use it.

I opted for the 4 tuner 1tb model as I figured this would hopefully future proof the device for the conceivable future. I ran into the first snag today, however, I went to turn three of my TVs in my home to the news as I moved about the house and I received an error that the tuners were busy. Thinking it was incorrect I called Amazon support and they informed me that the 4 tuner model can only record 2 shows and watch 2 shows even if you are watching the same channel. I find this to be kind of a big flaw that they don't mention in the description. I think 'four tuners' is false advertising as one would assume you could use all of them at the same time or any combination of watching or recording that adds up to 4. I won't echo the other comments about the user interface on the fire TV devices being lacking. However with my criticism I think this device has a lot of potential and I look forward to seeing what it becomes as an early adopter."},

My only complaint is a laundry lists of things that Amazon should improve over time. Maybe some of these features exist but I just haven't found them yet ... and by the way another minor complaint is that I haven't seen any kind of online user guide or handy-dandy how-to videos from Amazon ... so far I've just been slowly discovering features by poking around. That being said, here is the current list of dirty laundry (assuming you are watching via a Fire TV):"},
{"comment": "- Can't page through the program guide a day at a time. You have to scroll through hour-by-hour. Please fix this!"},
{"comment": "- I haven't figured out what good it does to mark channel as a \"Favorite\" other than a little heart shows up next to the channel. Near as I can tell you can't flip through favorites, or sort the program guide by Favorites, or do anything by Favorites."},
{"comment": "- If a program fails to record for any reason, you get a very informative message that says merely \"Failed to Record\". Really guys?"},

What if the same show is on both ABC's at the same time? is it going to try record from both channels at once? probably so, and I don't think there is any way to control this."},
{"comment": "- DVR recording options are very primitive. I gotta believe this is a known limitation and Amazon just wanted to get the product out the door (which I totally agree with)"},
{"comment": "- List of recorded shows is very primitive. I think I would prefer it sorted by newest-to-oldest, but even better would be multiple options for sorting."},
{"comment": "- No way to search through the channel guide, near as I can tell."},
{"comment": "- Kinda confusing how you access OTA channels and/or the channel guide in the first place. You can get to the most recently-viewed OTA channels from the \"ON NOW\" category on the home screen, and maybe or maybe not from \"RECENT\", and ... surprise ... you can also get to the program guide from the DVR menu which is pretty weird. But you can't get directly to the program guide from the home menu ... you have to somehow find an OTA channel and then press the \"Options\" key. [Update: another owner pointed out that from the \"ON NOW\" category you can navigate left to get to the program guide. Well hidden!]"},

Roku has just about every app you can imagine (YouTube/Pandora/Netflix/Amazon/Hulu/HBO Now) plus thousands of more apps in many different categories.Here are some points to consider when deciding on which model of Roku to buy:"},
{"comment": "1)If you need to connect by WiFi in a room far away from your WiFi router,I would recommend the Roku Streaming Stick PLUS or Roku Ultra."},

{"comment": "5)If you want to connect to an old TV with RCA/Composite audio/video jacks,you will need the Express PLUS"},
{"comment": "6)The Express and Premiere 2018 models have a remote where it has to be pointed at the device,unlike the other Roku models."},
{"comment": "7)If you are only going to buy one Roku device,I would recommend the Roku Ultra.The Ultra has many unique features that the other Roku models don't such as:"},
{"comment": "-Gaming buttons to play video games"},

{"comment": "For those who have not used a Roku before,here are some tips that might be helpful:"},
{"comment": "1)There is no monthly fee to use a Roku.There are many free channels/apps with free movies,music and TV programs and some people use Roku only for the free channels and do not pay any fees."},
{"comment": "You do NOT have to enter credit card info if you only wish to view free content and you can always add credit card info to your account later  for paid channels/apps.If you plan on viewing free content only,I suggest setting up a Roku account before you activate the device.When you reach the page to enter credit card info,some browsers will show a \"Skip,I'll add later\" option at the bottom.If you do not see this option,simply log out of your account,then log back in.You may have to then enter a different activation code for your device if you skip entering credit card info during device set up,but you do NOT have to enter credit card info if you only want to view free content."},
{"comment": "2)Some of the most popular free channels/apps are: YouTube,Pandora radio,The Roku Channel,Pluto TV,Tubi TV,Crackle,CBS News,NBC News,ABC,PBS, PBS KIds and many more.You can also find a free live stream of FOX News on YouTube by searching \"Fox News Live\" on YouTube."},
{"comment": "3)Some of the most popular paid channels/apps are Netflix,Hulu,Amazon video,HBO Now,Vudu,Sling TV,Spectrum TV and Direct TV Now."},
{"comment": "4)If you are looking for a bundle of channels of live TV to replace cable TV,check out Sling TV,YouTube TV,Spectrum TV,Direct TV Now,Hulu,Pluto TV and Playstation Vue.All of these are paid services except for Pluto TV,which is free."},
{"comment": "5)To find and add new channels on Roku,just press the Home button on the remote control,scroll down and select \"Streaming Channels\".There you will find thousands of channels/apps in many different categories and many of them are free."},
{"comment": "My one gripe about Roku (and other streaming devices) is the lack of a fully functional web browser and I hope Roku will include web browsing on models in the near future.I have been surfing the web on the big screen for years and find it ridiculous when an internet connected TV device does not allow you to surf the internet and forces one to switch to yet another internet connected device to do so."},
{"comment": "I am aware of screen mirroring  function from smartphone/PC/tablet but find that a poor excuse to not include a web browser.Many people who type a lot of messages and/or emails like myself prefer typing on a wireless keyboard rather than a phone/tablet/remote control."},
{"comment": "Bottom Line:You can now get a Roku device to replace your cable TV box & service or to replace an antenna for free local network TV.And of course you can create your own custom TV experience that simply is not possible with cable or antenna TV."},
{"comment": "I have to tell, this is the most wonderful and easy to use device I ever owned. I have a few Google cast sticks in my home, but the ROKU is much much better! I accidentally stumbled up on the thing as a recommendation from our cable guy. Where we live, Time Warner Cable was taken over by Spectrum and recently they decided to go all digital so every TV in my home needs a cable box, which was a sudden surprise because we have 6 TV-s and we just did some remodeling recently and work extra hard to have the TV-s on the walls neatly. We did not wanted to have anything around them because the space is limited and after all what's the point to hang a TV on the wall nice and flat and then install a stupid cablebox somewhere sticking out 3 times more and collecting dust... I know whit long enough HDMI cables and RF remotes we could solve the problem after all nothing is impossible these days but everything is extra cost and again just because Spectrum cable decided to not to send signal in their antenna cables anymore... So in this upsetting situation our cable guy came and save us whit a great advice, to buy a ROKU stick and check it out. The reason why the ROKU, because this is the one and only media stick which supports the Spectrum cable app and we can watch all the channels what they provide and we are paying for it already! Of course ROKU supports others as well, like NETFLIX and even Google Play, so they don't discriminate anyone! I can't do anything just recommend this little stick to everyone! I was worried about not to be able to record my favorite shows anymore, but the cable guy said, don't worry, because everything is on-demand these days, even if it's not the same day, you might have to wait a day or two, but that's okay we can live with that. Just in case we still have a DVR cable box in our living room on the biggest TV for shows like the Superbowl... :)"},
{"comment": "Set up was very easy and the stick supports 2.4 or 5 GHz WiFi signals so the streaming is buffering free all the time. Our cable guy said the main reason why they go all digital, because in the old way, the TV signal eat up half of their bandwidth and this will help to speed up the internet as well so at the end it's a win-win situation for everyone. And the ROKU stick helps a lot, we don't have to rent a cable box from the cable company for $11.00 per piece per month... We got ours on Amazon but it's widely available of course and for $40.00 it will bring back their price under a few months compare with the renting! The available channels and contents are overwhelming, we still learning what is worth to watch, but the combination of Netflix and Spectrum and our own Google account, the possibilities are virtually endless. And if you can't find anything you can stream your family or vacation movies from your own phones and tablets. Or listen Pandora radio for example!"},
{"comment": "AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!"},
{"comment": "Now I just have to buy 3 more for the kids rooms... Yay kids! :)"},
{"comment": "It is very rare when I write reviews but for a company who works this hard and created such a good little device they deserve it!"},
{"comment": "They even give away free HDMI extenders if your TV doesn't have a side HDMI port and you can't connect the ROKU stick in the back because your space is limited (which is the case with one of my TV-s)"},
{"comment": "When my cable bill nudged over the $200 per month mark I was furious.  I called Comcast our cable provider and asked them if they could do something about the price.  They didn't seem interested in cooperating with me.  So Roku here I am.  I've installed Roku on one of my television sets with excellent results.  The problem is that I don't watch half the programs normal cable systems provide. why pay for something you don't use?  Roku has so many great movies and shows.  Some have a nominal fee per month but not a thing like big cable charges.  We are very pleased with the results we have obtained.  You don't have to be a genius to set it up.  its a one time cost and I even purchased our own router instead of paying big cable a 10.00 a month rental fee.  I only wish I had gotten smarter sooner."},
{"comment": "I've used a few different streaming sticks (older roku model, Amazon fireTV stick, and whatever googles hunk of crap is called now). This by far has been my favorite and the only one I'd recommend to anyone. Same great Roku interface but the improved wi-fi capabilities ensure that it doesn't buffer when watching content (I typically use SlingTV, Hulu, Netflix and Youtube);works flawlessly with all those. Plus there is the new volume button on the remote that automatically synced itself to my TV so I was able to consolidate down to one remote! Highly recommend it to cord-cutters and anybody who regularly streams video content."},

{"comment": "I had not realized this was not intended for Canada when I first ordered it, but it works fine with Netflix and Amazon Prime, which is what I wanted to use it with."},
{"comment": "However, with Amazon Prime video, where the bitrate is device-dependent, one can end up using too much bandwidth, because the Roku default is quite high and there is no way to change it. (My TV and Google Wifi also don't have that option). There used to be a way to change it on the Roku, with a combination of buttons on the remote, but the ability to set a different bitrate has apparently been removed. On the Roku forum, I found other upset customers, but no solution. I wrote to Roku Customer support a week ago, but they did not reply. Given the internet caps in Canada, this is a dangerous object to use with services where the streaming quality cannot be limited - and I was disappointed by the lack of response from customer service."},
{"comment": "The remote and stick works fine, and the app is intuitive. But the bandwidth problem is a major one for me, as I tend to on a binge when I find shows that I like (and, on one such day, I inadvertently used 10 gigs of my monthly 100 in 24 hours....)."},

Puedes usar la Roku app para controlar el dispositivo si el control llegara a no funcionar a tu agrado. Tiene control de voz y puedes escuchar el audio v\u00eda celular usando la app de Roku con unos aud\u00edfonos. Tiene doble banda 2.4 y 5 ghz contrario a un Roku express.

{"comment": "Why you SHOULD get it:"},
{"comment": "This is hands-down the best tv streaming device out there. You just need to know (or google in about 5 minutes) how to use it. Most apps you need are in the included Google Play store, but you can side-load any android apps that aren\u2019t (google it). You can put third party apps on the home screen by adding shortcuts to them (google that too). It has Netflix and Amazon streaming apps pre-installed (you need to have an account for those respective services to use them). It can play any audio or video file type with the right app. You can plug-and-play an external hard drive, and transfer files to and from other computers and drives on your network. You can stream from any device on your network. The interface is better than Fire TV, and the new Fire TV doesn\u2019t have USB input for extra storage. You can use any programmable or learning (aka \u201cuniversal\u201d) IR remote. You can use any Bluetooth controller. You can stream live TV with the right apps if you\u2019re a subscriber to that live TV service. It\u2019s fast. It\u2019s small. It looks pretty cool. Not only does it work, but there is absolutely nothing I can think of that anyone would want to do with it as a video streaming device, that this device can\u2019t do. It is far and away the absolute best device for that purpose."},

{"comment": "The pocessing power is there. You can stream games from PC with the right setup, and it will work for that. In the long-run though, it\u2019s an android device. If your main intention for getting the Shield is gaming, I would recommend going with a PC, or a console instead. Retro games are flawless on the Shield, but for hardcore gamers of current games, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best choice."},
{"comment": "As a TV, Movie, Video, and retro-games media center though, the Shield TV and an external hard drive are the best possible option out there."},
{"comment": "As for the price. It\u2019s a little more expensive than some other options. It was massively on sale during the Thanksgiving and \u201ccyber\u201d sales period. If you want the best video media center, it\u2019s worth it."},
{"comment": "Why you SHOULDN\u2019T get it:"},
{"comment": "Maybe you don\u2019t need all of that. If you just want to stream Amazon and Netflix, a Fire TV is much cheaper and performs those functions just fine. The Shield is for people who want a lot more options in their media and more control over what, where, and how to play it. You just have to know or learn how to use it. If you don\u2019t need those extra perks, or the time and energy required to learn how to get it to do what you want isn\u2019t worth it to you, look elsewhere."},

{"comment": "As far as giving it one star because you don\u2019t like the remote: use a different remote."},

{"comment": "Game Emulation:5/5"},
{"comment": "I've gotten a few questions on emulation and gamepad input lag so I did some testing on a few different emulators. So far I've tested MUPEN64, Snes9x+, ePSXe, MD.Emu and NES.Emu. In all instances the software automatically mapped the NVIDIA Gamepad to appropriate buttons. All of the games I tested ran very smoothly, with a little bit of situational lag on the N64 Emu, but this was with settings maxed. I noticed absolutely no input lag from the gamepad and everything felt very responsive. It's possible people who are very sensitive to input lag may feel differently, YMMV."},
{"comment": "Gamepad: 4.5/5"},
{"comment": "The game pad is almost the exact same size as my XBOX ONE S controller with a button layout a little closer to a Sony DUALSHOCK controller, with the D-Pad being above the left stick. The game pad battery does not come fully charged so I suggest plugging it in and charging it after unboxing if you want to use it."},
{"comment": "Remote 4/5"},
{"comment": "The remote is not chargeable and does not use a traditional AA/AAA battery. It instead uses 2 \"CR 2032\" flat cell batteries that are claimed to last about a year. To change the batteries you need to use a fine point (pen etc.) to press in the small button on the bottom of the remote, the battery tray should then eject."},
{"comment": "UPDATE 1/21/2017: Like many of the other reviewers my remote is completely worthless now. Initially I did not notice any issues with it, but lately it is either lagging severely or not responding at all. Hopefully this can be resolved with software updates, if not NVIDIA is going to need to replace all of the remotes. My current remote version is 1.03."},
{"comment": "UPDATE 2/19/2017: Android TV 5.1 and remote firmware v1.05 both had a rollout on my device on 2/18/2017. The combination of these updates seems to have greatly improved the functionality of the remote. Aside from the initial lag when you \"wake\" the remote, it seems to be completely lag free now. Thank you NVIDIA for resolving this issue that has plagued so many of us."},
{"comment": "Voice Search: 3.5/5"},

If I say \"The Man in High Castle\" it will pull up a review and a cast list, but no option to watch on Amazon. But if I search \"X-Files\" It will show up as available to watch on \"Netflix\" and I can watch it. The voice search is supposed to get more support at a later date with the addition of Google Home features."},

{"comment": "UPDATE 1/17/17: I've recently been having issues with the other PCs in my house not being able to see the shield on the network. This is making it so I can't drop files directly on the shield. This initially worked when I got it set up, but is no longer. What I've been doing as a workaround is putting files into a shared folder I named \"SHIELD TRANSFER\" and pulling the files over using the free app \"ES FILE EXPLORER\". It's inconvenient, but it works. This will become more of an issue if I decide to host media on the shield and attempt to watch it on other devices. This issue may be isolated to my network."},

I have had a Firestick and an H96 Pro Plus before this and I was beginning to think that streaming was not going to be a good way to see movies.

Don't waste your money buying the others just because they are cheaper.  The Shield is worth every penny."},
{"comment": "This thing is awesome. Holy moly am I so happy to not be using my Samsung TV for streaming anymore. You know... One of the coolest things, it's so small...

{"comment": "Expensive, and the remote control is mediocre at best. How can this still get 5 stars then? Because this is Android TV at its very best, the performance is blazing fast without any hiccup or freezing no matter how demanding your multitasking is. It comes with Netflix and Amazon pre-installed (Yes, in Canada, and no, as of March 2018 VPN to watch US content doesn't work) and you can browse the Play Store for any other streaming or on-demand platform possibly available... plus media manager apps like Plex and Kodi - both work extremely well - plus sideloading Android apps.... It supports 4K, HDR, multiple channel surround sound including Dolby Atmos. Given the performance and the potential given by the Android platform, the Apple TV pales in comparison (And I'm an Apple user!). And note that this is the version without the controller (which you can add later of course) so I'm not even mentioning the gaming possibilities... This is a must-have in any living room, which is probably why you can't get much of a discount on this. Again, my only nitpick is the rather poor remote. You might want to add a bluetooth keyboard/mouse to this."},

This box is small, powerful, and supports all audio/video formats that are available. You can not go wrong. In some ways, it is overkill if you don't plan to use it for gaming at all. Personally, I just wanted a no-hassle, completely supported streaming box. This is the box to get. There is no point in buying other streaming equipment. It is also as future proof as it can be at this point."},

{"comment": "I only use this for streaming, so can't comment on gaming abilities. I bought this box in order to be able to upgrade to Kodi 17.3. Was using a MyGica 1800e android box which I found to be excellent, but only has 4.4 android, which when I bought it was the latest and greatest. Technology moves fast, so I purchased this Cadillac of streaming devices to hedge against further updates for a few years. This box is running android 7 so should last a few years before it become obsolete too. Be advised that this Android TV system is different than just plain old Android in that your Google Play store doesn't have the same apps as your regular Google Android phones and tablets. This means that Apps like Google Chrome, your own Vpn system, antivirus etc. cannot simply be downloaded from the Play Store and instead must be sideloaded. There's many videos and instructions available to show how to sideload apps, but not all your favorite Apps will work with Android TV. Works great for streaming but so did my 1800e so I don't see much difference in performance. Because I use an Ethernet connection, I can't comment on Wi-Fi performance. I use my old Rii8+ keyboard and it paired up flawlessly. I also use my Bluetooth headphones late at night and these also paired up without any problems (August 650's)."},

It's mostly useful in Netflix but you can play and stop in Kodi as well. I can see why people say it would be better to have a keyboard controller. Both controllers are okay but they each have their good so it can sometimes mean wanting to alternate between them when a keyboard remote could do it all. We may get one, but so far she is using Netflix the most and justs uses the voice activation. The speed is great on this and it looks sleek and quality. I think I made the right choice."},

Seems like the next step is to flash a recovery image directly onto the box, which is a huge PITA considering this is brand new. Since the new version of the Shield TV requires having a USB-A to USB-A cable to connect with a PC, which is fairly uncommon, I now need to go purchase that to continue debugging.

My wife bought the first one after waiting unsucessfully for me to sort out all the separate apps and sources for getting TV over the internet instead of paying the Cable TV company.  In principal, I think we sould be able to just pay for internet, and subscribe separately to what we want without the add-on mark up of cable.  However, I never found the time, and the Nvidia shield is a reasonalbe package that sets up quickly, to the point where I bought the second one without bothering to research the total do-it-yourself approach.  I get lots of selection of apps with independent selection and billing for each one.  First - run movies are way cheaper than cable and good reception.  Netfix selection is better than through cable,  And I don't watch tv commercials anymore (whew!  saved 15 minutes out of every hour!).  I don't know who doesn't get to be on the platform, but so far it is competitive enough to keep my happy and immersed in choice, at a substantial net cost saving over cable.  Hiccups:  I only have medium bandwith for my area, and am using T*****S***y on a dry-loop, so on a saturday night I may have to re-boot.  Be sure you have enough bandwith on your internet for you and your teens upstairs to be streaming at the same time.  Also, other bottlenecks in my other router system.  I have a Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIM0) on my main system, but connect through a range-extender(I have a 4 floor house) without MIMO - can cause slowdowns if someoneelse is streaming through the same range extender."},

If you're like me, your TV is already centered on 16\" studs anyway, so this mount should line up perfectly above or below it.  NOTE: I used sheet rock anchors that require a 1/4\" hole instead of the ones that were included.  The included 3/8\" anchors seemed like overkill since I was able to screw into two studs."},

{"comment": "While this product might be simple to install to any wall, I simply don\u2019t find value in the price. There are other products on Amazon that are cheaper and essentially do the same thing so I don\u2019t find this Sonos product worth it. While I love Sonos speakers (I own several Beams and several Sonos One speakers), I think they should either just include this mount with the Beam itself or just point people to third-party products."},
{"comment": "The main issue I have with it is that no matter what, you will need to install a power outlet behind the mount otherwise you will see power cords and wires running to your outlets and TV which defeats the purpose of having this shelf and having cords out of sight. A mount that hooks the speaker directly to the TV is preferred IMO."},
{"comment": "This sound bar mount is heavy duty and thick solid steel. Not flimsy Chinese garbage! I was amazed at the heft of this thing. It has 2 holes that align with the Sonos Beam perfectly. Forget all the other universal mounts. This mount is designed for the wires exiting the Bean and sets the Beam 1 inch from the wall so the sub woofer can operate on the back. As with all Sonos products.....perfect execution."},
{"comment": "This base is the SONOS designed product to go with BEAM speaker.  Like all Sonos products there is excellent engineering involved.  The Beam fits exactly on the base and the two screws and openings are magnetized to assist installation.  The open slots in the back give much leeway in mounting position.  The base insert allows for convenient placement of the power, HDMI and in my case, Ethernet cables.  I see there are less expensive mounts out now.  But for us it is well worth the Sonos original mount. I floated mount  above the tv using VESA brackets.  No need to drill into wall let the TV accessories do the work.  Very pleased with result."},

{"comment": "Fits the Sonos beam perfectly, as expected. Mounts to the bottom of the speaker using 2 supplied screws. I attached it to my articulating wall mount using a separate kit (for about $15), and it holds the Beam nice and solidly. Took about an hour to set up, but now I have a nice clean install. Not sure if it's quite worth the price, since it's pretty much a stamped and bent painted piece of metal with a few mounting screws, but you'd be hard pressed to find something else that looks as good."},
{"comment": "works well with the sound bar just wish the two screws that hold the bar onto the mount were a little longer holds well but seems a little weak for what is needed"},
{"comment": "I like the design as it mirrors the beam.  Good quality metal.  Drilled directly into the studs behind and used additional anchors where there were no studs to get a good secure hold.  Once the beam was attached the weight pulls down a bit so it isn't quite level - sloping forward.  Not the end of the world, but for the price of this small piece of metal, it should be better."},
{"comment": "Simply put - the fit and finish of this products is perfect.  You have to get up very close to the soundbar to see that it is mounted on this.  If you own a Sonos Beam and want to wall mount it or mount it below an articulated TV (as I did - I used this with the Mounting Dream Soundbar Mount Kit) this is the bracket to buy."},

The tv was placed on the mount and the post began to lean forward due to the weight of the tv. The tv is now secured with the sound bar underneath to take the pressure off of the tv mount post. Also the mounting screws that were included didn\u2019t support the updated tv. May have to purchase other screws for tv mount.  Other than that, the mount will most likely support TV\u2019s under 65 inches and weight less that 54 pounds. Please make sure you view the specifications of the tv and the tv stand mount before purchasing it. ."},
{"comment": "This TV stand is High Quality for my new small apartment. I waited a week to get this stand because they ship it UPS ground. I am happy I decided to purchase this high quality glass TV stand instead of buying something that I would get within a few days. I wanted something that looked good and that was easy to put together so I waited and I am so happy I did. Don't let the time it takes to get the stand deter you from purchasing it is very high quality glass and worth the wait. And...The stand sits at a good height. I have a 50 inch TV on it even though it can fit up to 55 inches."},

{"comment": "Was going to buy a similar product at Walmart, but decided to look on Amazon. I found this one with the added swivel feature. The box arrived and I was glad I purchased online and got it delivered to my door. All parts were present although one of the rods was wedged down in the box and took me a few extra minutes to locate. The instructions are not the best, but I successfully assembled it in less than an hour... mainly because my tv already had the mounts from a previous wall mount install. It looks as pictured and supports my curved Samsung admirably. I'm fully satisfied. Again, the instructions initially looked very cryptic, but I was able decipher and assembled without issues."},
{"comment": "We bought this for a new TV that was too big for our previous corner entertainment center.  I like the glass shelves. They look so sleek!  My husband had no trouble assembling this entertainment center.  I helped him flip it over once the shelves were done,  and it was quite heavy,  but manageable.  I was afraid it would be poor quality,  since the price was so low,  but we are very happy with it.  It makes a great addition to our modern-contemporary living room.  I would definitely buy it again."},
{"comment": "Had this for 6 months. Perfect for our tv size 55inch Toshiba.  I got bored of it being mounted on wall. This is great. Except  with toddlers... tv can be touched and reached by toddlers. Also the shelf is glass so beware of toddlers banging on it. I love how easy it us to move to another part of the room. Just drag over, not too heavy for a woman."},

The television sticks out almost fully extended from the wall, providing a >12 inch clearance. Excellent mount and I trust it to hold my 2000$ investment."},
{"comment": "This wall mount is everything it promised to be. It's sturdy, well-constructed, and I was impressed with the way it is engineered. So why not five stars? The instructions. Here's the thing .. it is put together very logically, and ample options/parts exist to accommodate anchoring choices and TVs. But none of that is explained for you."},
{"comment": "Here's an example. Where I would want to read:"},
{"comment": "\"Three sets of screws are provided for attaching the interface to the VESA holes on the TV. Use the set that fits the holes. The two smaller sets of screws require the use of the washer. The largest set of screws do not.\""},
{"comment": "Instead the instructions read:"},
{"comment": "(A,B)+G,C"},
{"comment": "Really? Is that Backus Naur or Reverse Polish Notation?"},
{"comment": "There is nothing in the instructions to tell you which way the four brackets are oriented. Would it have killed them to say \"The longer brackets are oriented horizontally, with the concave side facing the back of the TV.\" Finally, why not provide a table of the standard VESA mount measurements, and EXACTLY which hole on the brackets to use for that? Instead, it's trial and error."},
{"comment": "So my advice: Buy this mount. It's perfect for the job. But use the picture on the Mount Factory website to help with assembly. That picture, unlike the one in the included instruction page, is high enough resolution to clearly see what goes where."},
{"comment": "This is a great TV mount, with a good design, offered at a very nice price.  I've installed several mounts over the years for my own TVs, and as a part of cabinets for my clients, and its design, sturdiness, and finish compares very well, being second-to-none.  The snap-off/on covers that hide the attachment bolts, as well as the snap-off/on cable management channels, make for a beautifully neat and highly-functional installation."},
{"comment": "The only \"complaint\" that I have with the design is that the screws used to lock the TV's rotation (and prevent the TV from being lifted off of the mount), and the screws used to lock the tilt into place, are both somewhat \"hidden\" and look like all of the other screws (black), such that without the directions it isn't at all obvious which screws should be loosened/removed to alter the position of the TV.  This is especially true for the rotation/lift-off locking screws.  Don't get me wrong, the directions themselves are the typical modern-day hieroglyphics (at least these have a few English words in case you're not as good as Carter in deciphering pictographs!), but in this case are clear enough that installation was a breeze -- what I'm concerned about is remembering how to take it apart in a few years when a TV needs to be removed for some reason.  I have kept the directions in a drawer right near the TV, but we all know how easily those things get lost in the fog of time.  My advise would be to use some paint or nail polish to put a dot of color on the head of the screws used to lock down adjustments, so that the screws are a bit more obvious in the future."},
{"comment": "I would not hesitate to use/recommend this TV mount again the future, just remembering to keep the directions as a part of the installation."},
{"comment": "Instructions were mostly pictures.  Minimal tools required since a little wrench and level are included.  You need:  #2 phillips screwdriver, a drill and a 5/32\" drill bit (who has a 4mm bit?) for installing in wood stud walls, 12mm socket for the included lag screws.  The fact that they give you the lag screws is better than some other mounts.  I have included a few photos."},
{"comment": "I laughed at the review where the installer did not know that you can take off the part that attaches to the TV from the part that attaches to the wall."},
{"comment": "Before I start, I don't make reviews very often unless I am very satisfied with the product. It took us(My father and I) about 2/3 hours to install for one of 3 reasons. 1) we had to measure the tv and the wall to make sure that the tv was centered. 2) Then we had to measure where we wanted the mount to be and how high we wanted to mount it 3) We didn't read much of the instructions until we got the mount up. This unit is very sturdy, in the pictures I have provided(With a 55\" Samsung 4K tv) I can explain a few things that some of the reviews have complained about, excuse the mess(this setup is going to take a while to complete), and yes I know the tv is at an angle we did this on purpose. The angle it can go to knowing it is completely sturdy is astounding. The picture where it shows the middle of the mound with a few nuts screwed into the mount, this is where the wrench that comes with the parts of the mount is for. When we first put it up it was slightly offset. We fixed that with the wrench adjusting the angle of the tv and the offset of the television. The hardest part for us was figuring out the 4 metal pieces that make a rectangle to screw it into the tv, but the screw goes in on the holes at the end of the two vertical pieces. This mount comes with everything you need besides a stud finder, drill, and drill bits(you're going to need those). I hope this review helps for those of you that are thinking of buying or already bought the product and have or had a struggle with it."},

{"comment": "UPDATE (6/29/2018): I just purchased my 3RD CHEETAH MOUNT to install a Samsung QN75Q7 Flat 75\" QLED that my sister just bought for her new home.  Although the pre-assembled VESA 400x400 configuration may benefit owners of smaller TVs, it did take a few extra minutes to unassemble and reassemble the mount to use on her 75\" TV.  Although the Samsung is a 400x400 VESA configuration, due to the weight of the TV (90lbs), I wanted to make sure the mount was attached to the wood studs which required the expanded pieces.  WARNING FOR ANY OTHER SAMSUNG TV OWNERS (65\" or larger):  The  four (4) M8 screws provided by Cheetah are not long enough to use on the VESA hanging rails.  I had to go to the local hardware store and pick up longer M8 bolts (about 20mm longer) and about $0.37 each.  Other than that hiccup, the mount works great for her new Samsung TV."},

I would have also put screws into the center stud if my TV was heavy but at only 37 lbs did not feel that necessary. I then screwed the TV mount to the board with 10 3/8 by 1\" lag screws.

{"comment": "Couple suggestions I wanted to throw out there due to some of the other reviews:"},
{"comment": "- Never, I repeat NEVER mount anything over 30 lbs using wall anchors. Not sure why they include them, but just say no! I always buy a 1\"x8\" board that I mount to the wall into 2-3 studs. Then mount the TV mount to the board. This allows you to center the TV wherever you want regardless of where the studs are AND gives the mount a nice solid area to be secured to."},
{"comment": "(READ BELOW FOR UPDATE!)Installation was pretty uneventful.  Instructions were precise and package provides for every mounting possibility.  Came different sized screws and spacers which was impressive.  Also came with a magnetic level, but I ended up using a my larger (reliable) level.  Once bracket was mounted, got tv up in the wall in no time.  For the price, a really sweet deal. Now the reason I knocked off  two stars, wall mount piece in picture was different from what I received.  Mine only had 4 screwholes on each edge and 4 adjustable screwholes towards the middle.  With the way my studs are located I had to move the mount 3 inches from the center since the edge screw holes are not adjustable, they're just holes on each edge.  I'm thinking it's an older version I received.  Yes I know there are several remedies to fix that shortcoming, like mounting a piece of plywood to the studs then attaching the mount to the plywood."},

I went to Lowes and purchased M8 1.25 x 40mm screws (see attached picture) and washers to use for the bottom holes of the bracket which fit perfectly. I used the M8 25mm screws that came with the mount for the top holes of the bracket on the back of the TV. Other than this caveat with the screws the mount fit my TV perfectly and is a solid device. Very happy with this purchase."},
{"comment": "This is the mount you need. Yes, it's a few more bucks than some of the mounts out there - but you likely just spent anywhere from 500 to several thousand on your TV, so why try to save 20 bucks on a cheap mount? This is the best mount I've ever seen. It's incredibly well made and moves my 70\" Sony XBR effortlessly. It was very easy to install - took maybe 30 minutes - TAKE IT SLOW. You don't want to mess it up and not drill directly into the studs. If you don't drill directly into the studs, the mount is useless because it's so well made, the mount (especially with the TV on it) will just rip out of the dry wall. So you HAVE to drill directly into two studs."},
{"comment": "A couple of things I noticed that may help your decision to purchase:"},
{"comment": "-The way they have you put it all together is great and makes it a breeze. The bigger the TV, I'd absolutely recommend you having 2 people. But if you have a 40\" or below, you should be fine to do it yourself. You attach the two bracket pieces to the back of the TV. It gives you a few different sized screws so you'll have the correct ones for the holes on the back of your TV. My TV had screws in the holes that came with it, but not all TVs do. So they give you multiple sizes to ensure you can connect the 2 bracket pieces correctly. Then you install the mount to the wall. It takes some patience and measuring to make sure you're directly drilling into the middle of the studs, but once you do that, you're all set. You lift the TV and put the bracket pieces over the mount bars and the TV is on there. Then use the bracket fasteners that make sure it's fully secured to the mount. One thing to note - it's \"on there\" before you even put the bracket fasteners on. But you absolutely want to put the bracket fasteners on because there is a chance the TV would come off the mount over time by moving it back and fourth on the mount if you don't use the fasteners. But you don't have to worry about holding the TV on the mount and attaching the bracket fasteners at the same time...the TV rests on the mount and then you put them on to ensure it can't fall off."},
{"comment": "-The multiple holes on the base where you attach the huge bolts/screws that go into the studs - they are arranged so on the outside chance your studs are not perfectly distributed 16\" (the norm), you'll still be fine. For some reason, one of mine was more like 15 instead of 16...not a problem. Again, just make sure you drill directly into the stud."},
{"comment": "-The bolts they give you are very large and you need the appropriate drill bit. You're not going to be able to screw them in without drilling first I can't remember what size it was, but it tells you in the directions."},
{"comment": "-The directions were pretty good and easy to follow. It's really not that hard, but it's nice to have guidance and I'd suggest reading it all first instead of just trying to do it without reading it."},
{"comment": "-The \"functions\" and \"usability\" of this mount are phenomenal. It's extremely well made as I've mentioned, but pulling it out or pushing it back in, tilting it, moving it...all very easy, but it still stays secure in the place you want it. It won't just randomly move or tilt for no reason. I listen to very loud music and movies and the bass never makes it shake or tilt or move. It's easily the best mount I've seen."},
{"comment": "In conclusion - buy this mount if you're looking for a way to secure your beloved TV to the wall. It's the best mount I've come across and it gives me complete peace of mind that my several thousand dollar investment, while \"hanging on the wall\", is safer and more secured than ever."},
{"comment": "I ordered this mount for our new Samsung Q70R 65\" TV as this is exactly what I was wanting."},
{"comment": "The mount is very well designed and has a finished look, smooth rounded edges just makes it clean looking when installed.  The other mounts that have the rectangular mounting plates are unappealing especially when it's hanging in the living room and very noticeable."},
{"comment": "This mount is made for either mason or stud wall installation on 16\" centers with a little room to maneuver. Once installed, the full motion arm assembly  can be adjusted to the left or right to center on the wall and is very easy to adjust. Installation could not have been easier especially when using the provided install template (less than 20 minutes)! The only snag I ran into was the spacers for the mounting brackets on the TV. The included hardware was great but the bolts were a little too long and the large spacers were to big so I used the spacers that came with the TV  and the small spacers that came with the mount. In order to shim it out enough to where the bolts did not bottom out on the panel I added 1 2mm nylon space for each bolt and it was the perfect spacing.  The actual mount is an elongated \"H\" that allowed me to install a 2 gang power bridge in the open area of the mount without it interfering with the arm when placed flush to the wall. The kit I used was the Arlington TVBR2505K Flat Panel TV Cable Organizer 2-Gang Kit with Recessed Power Solution  purchased on Amazon as well."},
{"comment": "So If you look at my pics the first one is of the TV as close to the wall as it gets. In case you can't tell it is only like 4 inches or so away from the wall. This would depend on the size of your TV but it is close and clean."},
{"comment": "- I tend to go overkill on the weight estimates. If the TV weighs 40 lbs, I aim for a mount that can handle double (one because knock-off mounts can't be trusted, and 2 it's kind of an insurance policy)."},
{"comment": "- Ignore the size of your TV. All the matters is the WEIGHT and the TV MOUNTING POINTS. My tv is setup for 15.75 inch x 15.75 inch (400mm x 400mm) mounting and only weighs 50lbs, so this mount was perfect."},
{"comment": "- Try to mount the arms to the center of your TV. Not all mounting holes are centered for weight balance. This is most likely the problem people are having with the it tilting too much. This means there's too much weight at the top."},
{"comment": "I purchased this wall mount in February 2018 to mount a 55\" TCL 55S401 in my family room. The TCL is 55\" and weighs around 35lbs. The VESA mount is a 200 X 200 VESA mount. While the Cheetah wall mount includes several different sets of screws to accommodate a variety of TVs, my TV needed a four  M6 x 16MM screws. Cheetah included an M6 x 20MM set of screws. I dropped into the hardware store and picked up a set of 4 M6 X 16MM screws and washers for $3.40."},
{"comment": "Overall, I am very happy with this wall mount and I will buy another one when I get a TV for my office. I can easily recommend this TV mount.

I always end up saying ugh why are these so expensive."},

{"comment": "I received the TV Wall Mount from Mountain Dream. Unfortunately, the spacing of my wall studs is 24 inches which is beyond the 16 inch capacity of this product. PLEASE make sure to measure your stud spacing before buying ANY mount, not just this one. Most mounts only cover 16 inches so the mount specs and stud spacing needs to be verified before purchase. I was upset that mount did not match my needs so I left a bad review, I shouldn\u2019t have been so quick, because it was not entirely Mountain Dreams fault, 16 inches is relatively standard."},
{"comment": "The good folks at Mountain Dream contacted me shortly after I received their mount and they worked with me to get my TV up. They really went above and beyond to not only get this TV up but also to get it setup low profile, I did not want it sticking to far from the wall. I really appreciate all their technical support and courteous emails. I am gladly changing my review of them and their product to as good as it gets. The mount is a bargain to begin with but the mount followed by their stellar support makes it the bargain of the century (well, maybe not a century but at least the best deal I have had all year). I recommend this mount to anyone needing a no frills, low-pro mount that is solid and safe."},
{"comment": "I cannot say enough about how great this product is. These TV wall mounts are $50-$100 in the brick and mortar stores. I paid 15 bucks. Keep in mind this is a simple wall mount, it does not tilt or swivel. If all you need is a simple wall mount this is exactly what you want. I used it to hang an older 42\" Insignia plasma tv. The mount is rated to 100lb. These older tvs are twice as heavy as a new flat screen, probably 40-45lbs. This mounts holds this tv easily."},
{"comment": "When I originally saw the tiny box it came in I was really concerned. When I opened it, it was full of parts and pieces all individually packaged. I was thinking what is all this stuff. Well let me tell you, the people who designed this mount thought of everything! It has the lag bolts to mount the bracket, it as 2 sizes of bolts in multiple lengths to mount the bracket, it has multiple size standoff spacers to space the mounting hooks away from the back of the tv. This was critical for my installation because my older tv had the hdmi on the back of the tv. Without the spacers my hdmi cable would be hitting the wall preventing the hoos from snapping fully into place. They even included a tiny level you can attach to the wall bracket to insure it is straight. Again they thought of and included EVERYTHING you could need for all types of tv's.

I had a little trouble picking the right screws and spacers to hang my particular tv as the mount came with every possible combination and size of screw you could need.  That is a good thing, but wow, I had to try a lot.  Other than that it was very easy.  Bolt the mount to the wall, screw the attachment bars on to the back of the tv with the provided hardware and hang the tv on the mount.  there are locking straps to keep the tv secure, although you can still move it side to side.  To remove from the wall simply pull on the straps and tilt the tv up."},
{"comment": "I wanted to mount my 55\u2019 prior to Christmas. Ordered on 22nd and arrived the next day. Item is as described. Once I found the wall studs the job was done in less than 5min. (Well, I hung 3 more TVs in the house before so I am somewhat experienced). I of course didn\u2019t need all the extra nuts and bolts for the job but I am sure to use them for something else. Thank you!"},
{"comment": "I like the fact that all various screws and things are included, so you don't have to run to hardware store to get some additonal harware in last minute."},
{"comment": "-No documentation related to specific TV brands. It  would have been very helpful if Amazon provided something like a guide to the most common screws/spacer combinations for the major TV brands or sizes so you didn\u2019t have to just guess and try diff ones over and over again."},

{"comment": "Overall given that I only payed $20 for this mount I can\u2019t complain too much although I must say I was expecting set up to be a little more intuitive just based on the fact this was an Amazon-made product.  If you were looking for something cheap and you are trying to minimize the amount of damage to your walls this is not a bad option just be prepared to spend double the amount of time you THINK it should take! :)"},
{"comment": "Easy installation. *make sure to have a 10mm socket wrench to install bolts! Can be frustrating to use a screw driver. Easy to do with socket wrench!"},
{"comment": "This is a well engineered, high quality TV mount.  The metal parts move smoothly, have no play and the powder black finish looks nice.  I was impressed with the quality and ease of installation. You can set the swing arm tension so there is a smooth and even resistance, and the TV stays put.  One important detail that every DIY installer would want to know is, how do I connect the TV to the wall bracket, or do I put it all together (TV and all) then try to mount it on the wall?  Do I need a buddy to hold up the whole thing for the final install?  Surprisingly this detail is missing from most product descriptions.  This one at least, you can install easily by yourself, because the backing plate which screws on to the back of your TV, will slide in easily and hang securely from the wall bracket arm.  You can then install the screws to secure the connection.  You don't need to hold up the TV end while you do this.  It's quite well thought out."},
{"comment": "Amazon is the man! This is a quality wall mount for a great price! I was worried it might be cheap or feel inadequate. No dice! This thing is legit. It is fully articulated, so it moves in just about any way you'd want up/down, side/side, tilt, it provides plenty of viewing angles. It is also very well built. It is solid metal with heavy duty hinges. It's not messing around, this mount means business. Installation was relatively painless, it does help to have a second person for when you are trying to center/level the mount, and the step of hanging the TV, but one person could definitely swing it if you were feeling frisky. Don't be scared by the price. This is not junk. It isn't going to break the first time you look at the TV funny. It's a serious wall mount for an unbeatable price."},
{"comment": "Great purchase.  Would buy again.  In fact I am going to buy another one."},
{"comment": "First of all, at less than $25, this is a steal compared to other wall mounts at retail stores and other online sellers."},
{"comment": "Second, super easy installation.  It took me about an hour and fifteen minutes.  But it only took me that long because I'm a neat freak, super anal, and neurotic about putting holes in my wall.  And also because no one would answer my calls or texts when I called for help attaching my 43 inch TV to the mounted bracket.  I had to jury rig a ladder and grow a third arm to do it myself.  My friends are bums."},
{"comment": "I'm deducting half a star because I don't like the way the cover attaches to the wall portion of the bracket.  As far as I can figure, it doesn't snap into place.  It just hangs there.  It looks fine when you carefully cover the arm with the cover, but since it doesn't snap into place it comes right off when you move the arm.  I'll have to get some double sided tape."},

{"comment": "TIPS FOR THE NON-TECHNICAL..."},
{"comment": "Make sure you secure it to wall studs properly. If you don't want to poke test holes in your wall to find them and you don't have a \"stud finder\", spend the $10-20 dollars to get one. Handy to have around the house anyway. You can get one right here on Amazon. DO NOT USE drywall wall plug anchors. Even the aggressive screw-in type are not sufficient. Its VERY unlikely that the manufacturer of your 65\" OLED tv, that cost you $3000, will warranty damage due to careless and negligent mounting. Especially when it falls off the wall, shatters, and you send it back in a thousand pieces. A pricey lesson to learn. Use the appropriate screws and hardware for your application. If you have wood studs then get some heavy duty wood screws. Get at least a #6 thread, #8 is too small in my opinion. If you live in a condo then you likely have aluminum studs. You can use \"self tapping\" or \"self drilling\" screws. You need a drill to push either one through a metal stud. The configuration of the wall mounting plate will allow you to put (4) screws into studs to secure it. (2) upper, (2) lower. If you have aluminum studs you may want to consider putting extra support in as the (4) stud screws will only be holding onto thin sheets of aluminum. You want to make sure they are each tightly holding in the aluminum. If you over tighten, then you risk stripping the hole in the aluminum, and you will have less or no support at all from that screw. Use a drill to penetrate the aluminum, use a hand screwdriver to finish so you can \"feel\" when its tight, and not strip the hole. If I had aluminum studs, I would also put (1) upper and (1) lower wall plug/screws in the center of the bracket to help support the (4) stud screws, just to be safe. I suggest screw in EZ Anchors, they are solid. With wood, use @ least (4) #6 (min. 2\") screws and you'll be set. Regardless of your stud type, use washers to ensure the screws do not slip through the bracket slots when tightened. You may need washers regardless if the diameter of your screw head is smaller then the bracket slot's. It's a good precaution even if you don't need to. Beyond mounting the bracket securely, the instructions will clearly explain the rest of the assembly process. As there are \"hook\" brackets that attach directly to your tv when its still on the floor, you are able to easily lift it up, and set it onto your completed ECHOGEAR wall mount assembly with ease. Be sure to center it it on the mount to distribute weight evenly as mentioned in the instructions. Then screw in the provided brackets on the lower rail to secure it. Very easy! Just be sensible. Although you can't wait to try your new tv, today's new generation are fairly fragile and can't sustain any drops or bangs. Be patient, get someone to help you lift it so that you don't hurt your back, and you don't end up with a broken tv, which MAY be on your credit and not repairable. If you spent this kind of $$$ on a tv, spend the few dollars for proper hardware, and do it right. It's worth it. If you are not comfortable doing it, ask a friend for help or hire someone to install it properly for you."},
{"comment": "Best of luck, enjoy!"},
{"comment": "I have a 55\u201d Samsung and this system works perfectly. Easy to assemble and mount on wall. Super sturdy and swing out works well. I took time to work through the product selection and was not disappointed. However, here are some things to consider. 1) the wall bracket will not fit studs wider than 16\u201d. If wider is needed you need the related product or you need adddtional screws to mount on a centre line. 2) on my Samsung the brackets attached to the TV just fit - another 1-2 cm and it would\u2019ve been a no go. So if you have a larger set be very sure you consider that. I had to fit a screw assembly to get a good fit but they supply lots of screw lengths and spacers to work that out. 3) I got the sound bar mount too. Fit well but seems to be a bit wonky in that the stiffness is not there and the bar can be readily moved leading to it not be dead parallel with the TV which I find really annoying. It stays once you set it up but if you inadvertently bump it you have to re-align it. Not bad for adults but the kids are always pushing out of alignment."},
{"comment": "All that said it is a good product, does what it says and seems to be excellent quality and there is loads of room for adjustments for I am sure hundreds of flat screen models - but it isn\u2019t 100% universal. Measure carefully my friends."},

{"comment": "For the low price and taking the complaints with some healthy skepticism, I went ahead and ordered this mount instead of just ordering a $100 mount. I was pleasantly surprised. It appears that the manufacturer has been paying attention to the feedback and has addressed several of the complaints and even included documentation pointing out the changes to the mount. I'm going to address each of the points listed above with my observations."},
{"comment": "COMPLAINT: 1. Poor or confusing instructions"},
{"comment": "MY EXPERIENCE: If you have never put together a piece of furniture from ikea, yes, you may be confused by these instructions. If however, you have done any home repairs beyond replacing a light bulb, you will be able to figure this out without any confusion. For me, this was simple and easy. Maybe this is one of the things Cheetah fixed."},
{"comment": "COMPLAINT: 2. Cheap or flimsy construction"},
{"comment": "MY EXPERIENCE: The metal construction of this mount is actually stronger then I expected. It appears as thought they have changed the design to use stronger parts. Yes, the hooks that you attach to the VESA mount on the TV and use to hang the TV on the bracket are not as robust as the metal on the wall bracket, but they are more then enough for the task at hand. I didn't experience them as being flimsy or at any risk of bending. The documentation did point out that they had included new stronger lag bolts, but still warned not to over tighten them."},
{"comment": "COMPLAINT: 3. Inability to hide the cables that pull to release the display"},
{"comment": "MY EXPERIENCE: Cheetah now includes two magnets to stick onto the handles of the pull tabs so you can easily hide the pull tabs back up under the TV."},
{"comment": "COMPLAINT: 4. Once mounted, you can move the bottom of the TV on the mount (there is a little play)"},
{"comment": "MY EXPERIENCE: Yes, this is true. Once the TV is mounted to the wall, you can press against the TV and there is a little play on the bottom of the TV. This doesn't really bother me. Once the TV is mounted on the wall, I don't actually go touch the TV. I use the remote control, so if there is a little room for play  on the bottom of the mount, this doesn't actually affect the function or performance of the mount. This is just me. I am sure that just knowing that there is play in the mount will bug some people to no end. If you already know that something like this will bug you, this isn't the mont for you."},
{"comment": "COMPLAINT: 5. You have to assemble parts to extend the mount to anything larger then 16\" studs"},
{"comment": "MY EXPERIENCE: The mount has a small main rail that you can mount all by itself to the wall. This is 16\" wide. If the studs in your wall are perfectly spaced so that the center point of the TV would fall exactly between these two studs, then you are all set. If like 95% of the rest of us, you are going to experience something less then the perfect situation, this mount is adaptable. It comes with extra rail sections you can attach to lengthen the wall mount. This allowed me to extend my wall mount and be less precise with how centered the wall mount was on the wall. I made sure the main 16\" portion was where I was going to hang my TV and I used the extra extension to reach out to the next set of wall studs to make sure the wall mount was securely braced against the wall. The holes for the lag bots to score into the studs were oval shaped so that I even had flexibility to drill the hols i the studs and have some ability to adjust."},
{"comment": "COMPLAINT: 6. Don't use the included level. It isn't accurate."},
{"comment": "MY EXPERIENCE: I already own a very good level, so I didn't even check the included level. That being said, on my first attempt to hang the TV on the wall, I discovered that while my TV was perfectly level, my house was not. I live in an older victorian and the built in wainscoting and crown moulding were sloping towards the back of the house. Actually, I suspect the whole house slopes. So having the TV perfectly level was actually a bad idea. I took the TV off the wall and adjusted the hanging brackets by loosening the screws into the VESA mount points and moving the brackets on the left down a little. In fact, when you are first mounting the brackets to the back of your TV, you put the screws through long oval slots rather then a round hole. This gives you the freedom to adjust the brakes up or down by about an inch. I recommend mounting the brackets in the middle of the oval hole so that you have room to adjust up or down if you need to make some fine adjustments."},
{"comment": "MY ONLY COMPLAINTS:"},
{"comment": "If you need to adjust the tilt of the TV or the leveling of the TV, you will need to take the TV off the wall and make the adjustments. I know that there are other mounts out there that make this a slightly easier process. You only need to make this adjustment once and then you are done. For me, I didn't see that convenience worth paying 4X the price of this mount. I know that this cost/value equation is different for everyone. For me, this wall mount is great and I will happily get another one when the time comes to hang another TV."},

{"comment": "This TV should be easy to set up (if you have the proper tools...I didn't). The instructions are simple and straight forward, comes with multiple bolt lengths and thickness to accommodate most standard TVs.

I am guessing most normal household might have a proper tool kit so this shouldn't be a turn off."},

When I have the VGA port from my computer in it wont lock into the mount on one of the rails.  You could cut a small hole in the wall but just keep in mind if your cables stick out far it's going to be tough.  You also have to remove the TV from the mount every time you change a cable, so get it ready with the cables in the back BEFORE you mount it to the wall. I put an extra HDMI cable in there and cable tied it in an area I can pull it down when I need it to not have to remove it later. (it is pretty easy to remove, pull the straps and lift."},

{"comment": "El manual indica que se debe de montar por dos personas, yo les quer\u00eda dar la sorpresa a mi esposa e hijas y lo hice solo.

Lo solucion\u00e9 pegando con cinta canela el iPhone en modo selfie y me gui\u00e9 as\u00ed (un espejo puede darles el mismo resultado), fuera de ese paso que es cargar la pantalla de unos 15-20 kilos y embonarla, todo lo dem\u00e1s es posible hacerlo con mucha facilidad uno mismo.

{"comment": "As mentioned above, I have been using this mount for almost a month. The actual mount feels extremely solid. Wall bolts provided were thick and felt secure once bolted into studs. Because of the accordion arms, the TV does sit a couple inches off the wall, not too far, maybe 3inches, which does not bother me. I'm hanging a 55\" tv with mine, the max recommended,  no issues at all. Every night I swivel my TV to face my bed, moves smoothly and solid.

The only slight negative that I would say is the the left and right mounting holes are not quite 16\" centered.  I had to mount the left screw into the center of the left stud and then angle slightly the right screw into the top and bottom right holes to hit the stud.  Not a big deal but you would think that since most studs are 16\" centers, and their directions even state this, that the distance between the holes would be a minimum of 16\" with a little even to spare.  Overall, a great well-built wall mount that offers side to side movement, forward and backward movement, and tilt movement."},

This made it necessary to level it with the provided Allen key. Then scoped it away from the wall about a foot and shifted farther to the side some more. Also tilted the screen down a bit because it is mounted nearly 5 feet high (centre) to clear sound system. Looks great and I can swivel it a bit if I have extra company over. It is not cheap thin metal. It has decent weight to it. Well made to serve the intended purpose."},

This is good for me because as you can see in the reflection of the TV is a door and outside that door is where I usually BBQ...so I can watch TV while BBQ'ing.

Fortunate for me the studs in my wall were exactly where the holes/slots needed them to be."},
{"comment": "Over all I give it 5 stars. You cant beat the price and it is secure. Just make sure you are aware how close to the wall it is. You could make your own spacer and go to a hardware store and get 4 longer machine screws for your TV if you were so inclined. A 1/2 inch would make a big difference for your cables."},

Was mounting the arm to the tv and the screw broke, thought maybe we can still make it work and started to put on the other arm - another screw broke. I was using a manual screw driver and am a woman who is not overly strong. Now we can even mount our tv because the screws are stuck in the tv. Very disappointed as I have bought other mounts from different manufacturers and have never had any problems. I do not recommend this product. One star for clear and organized packaging."},

{"comment": "The wall plugs given also looked small compared to the screws, I just used my own which are a lot chunkier and stronger. Really the only reason for a 4 star instead of a 5 is due to the overall weight and the undersized wall plugs provided."},

{"comment": "Overall a good product, you\u2019ll need a power drill, Phillips head screwdriver and 10mm wrench to properly install.

{"comment": "I would definitely recommend this product. I am very pleased with it."},
{"comment": "This was an easy installation, the most difficult part was the measurements I had to take, to ensure that the TV would be the height I wanted.  I mounted it halfway between a large clock on our wall, and the stereo cabinet that the TV was sitting on before purchasing this mount.  Once I completed the measurements, the installation was easy and went smoothly.  The TV swivels easily, and can be moved right to left to center it if necessary; in our instance, I centered it with the clock on the wall above the TV.  Highly recommend this item.  It's very sturdy also."},
{"comment": "As soon as I opened the box I realized that this thing is built like a tank. I was wondering for the price how sturdy it would be. My application is for a large computer monitor so though I did not need a super strong mount this one is ready for heavy lifting, For those of us who order such things on line - this comes with clear directions - and if you are handy - then you'll appreciate that the hardware is all there in separate packets. Plus an HDMI cable, Velcro cable ties AND a level? Nice touches."},
{"comment": "I have a 43\" TV and it I can't complain. I like the swivel feature, makes it easy for me to sit at my computer and watch TV since my computer isn't directly in front of it. And the tilt adjustment is nice to help angle the TV so the sun doesn't project such a harsh glare on it. It extends a nice amount as well. Directions were easy enough to follow."},

{"comment": "The two parts of the bracket that attach to the TV were fastened at their extreme ends, so no facility for altering the vertical height of the TV other than moving the bracket.  The section that fits to the wall could be made slightly longer for installations where the bracket needs to be off centre of the vertical studs.  The full articulation and being able to slide the TV off centre, (not too far) compensates a bit.  Our media wall was built with multiple vertical studs just in case."},

{"comment": "1 - The wall plate holes are exactly 16\" apart at most, so you better hope your studs are properly spaced apart to the mm...you might have to go a little off center from the stud to get this thing mounted."},
{"comment": "2 - The wall plate holes don't have much height to them either, so you need to be fairly exact when drilling your holes to fit the lag bolts through (Otherwise the bolts may hit the plate and want to go in at an angle which isn't going to work out very well for you)"},
{"comment": "3 - The lever to adjust tightness of the screen tilt mechanism gets either pinned between the TV and the Extension bar so it cannot be moved at all once mounted. (This is what my situation is)  Or, it would have to get tightened beyond the extension bar, but you wouldn't be able to go backwards to loosen it."},
{"comment": "3. Bracket feels flimsy."},

{"comment": "4. Rawlplugs supplied are cheap."},
{"comment": "This I have to agree but i never ever use rawlplugs that have been supplied for products I buy, I use my own which I know will hold. For this bracket I used a medium duty, multipurpose rawlplug and screws. Didn't bother with the supplied screws."},
{"comment": "5. Spirit level that came free is not accurate."},

{"comment": "Me and my 14-year-old daughter were able to put this on the wall in about an hour. Like I said the longest part of it was us measuring and making sure it was low enough on the wall that the TV wouldn\u2019t bump the ceiling."},

{"comment": "I ordered this for a Samsung UN65RU7100 TV. This kit DOES include the required M8 -1.25 x 45mm bolts for that model TV. I used the spacers **that were included with the TV** (The back panel of the TV is curved from top to bottom, so the long spacers that came with the TV were needed for the TV brackets to attach). That is something to keep in mind when you set up a new TV. Even if you think you will never need extra bits like that, bag, label, and keep them!"},
{"comment": "I keep the TV all the way back against the wall - I only got a full motion mount so I can pull it out if I need access to ports later. As others said, it is pretty stiff, and on a 65\" TV with very little bezel, it is a nervous thing to put that much pressure on it to move it around. I made sure to grab at the top and bottom of the TV, since the bottom is thicker and less flexing than the sides."},

{"comment": "Pessima esperienza."},

{"comment": "Unfortunately, the strongest chain is only as strong as its weakest link and the weakest link here are the horizontal rails at the end of the bracket arms, from which the TV hangs. These are pretty thin and light compared to the other components of the bracket assembly. They bend and torque quite easily under the 35 kg TV. This results in a very wobbly TV whenever it's moved, ruining the feel of what would otherwise be a very sturdy bracket"},
{"comment": "This bracket is extremely heavy duty. Amazon make it super easy to install, providing a template for your drill holes, that you tape to the wall, so you can't go wrong."},
{"comment": "The 4 screws provided should be avoided if possible, use your own if you have them. One of the screws sheared off in the wall as i was driving it in with a ratchet. Luckily, its still very strong on 3 screws, and as its one of the bottom ones, i progressed."},
{"comment": "Getting the TV onto the bracket can be a little tricky. Apply the bottom hooks before the top ones and you'll be fine. Its worth noting as well that when hooked on, the TV is somewhat free to slide over and back on these hooks."},
{"comment": "Have to say, the range of motion avaialble to the TV through this bracket is great. In, out, side to side, swivel up or down, and the way you can make levelling adjustments is just great."},

I was scared to death it was going to fall off the wall and NOTHING was going to be able to hold the weight!! My dad installed it and assured me all would be good.  He was right - 10 months later and it's still snug on the wall :) I tilt it regularly so i can see it from my bed and the arms are still perfectly straight. I Highly recommend this product.  THANK YOU TO ALL who wrote reviews before i bought - you definitely helped me to pick the right one!"},
{"comment": "Due to the location of the TV a regular two stud wall mount would not have been acceptable."},
{"comment": "This unit is solid, flexible and easy to install and comes with everything required.  I enjoy the humour on their website, and documents.  Nice to know they actually support their products 24/7.  The only small things I would note is that it doesn't clearly delineate the range of ability to move the whole unit side to side (its up to approx 5.4 inches but a vertical line would be nice to help indicate as in \"don't go past this point\" right or left.  Also the method to release and then tighten up that side to side movement IHMO could be better engineered.  It works but it could be done better.  Would I recommend this wall mount.  Hell yeah!  For that matter I would get this mount for myself even if my wall studs were perfectly positioned due to the added flexibility the design provides.  I might like it one way but the signficant other demands it be slightly more to the left LOL.  Dont bother with expensive wall mounts sold in the stores......... overpriced and I doubt as functional as this unit."},
{"comment": "To explain why I've given this 5* - over the years I've actually installed 6 tv wall brackets now, and although this was the heaviest, it's also THE best, most substantial, most versatile and without doubt the best value for money !

{"comment": "Can't recommend this enough, and I've not been paid for this review.....this really is THAT good so buy it, you won't be disappointed !!"},
{"comment": "Looking at the pictures on Amazon I wasn't to sure about the quality of the bracket and if it would support the weight of the TVs mentioned but can rest assured the quality of the actual bracket is great and weighty in itself. Had a little trouble in my case as my walls down stairs are studded every 800mm instead of the standard 400mm. The bracket measured in at just over 400mm so was only able to brace it to one stud and secured it with wall anchors and bolts and it ain't going anywhere anytime soon. It's supporting a 32\" in the living room and the swing action is great for watching tv in the dinning room when having dinner"},
{"comment": "I have this holding a 42\" television on the wall and I am very happy with it. The TV sticks out no further than a radiator and feels perfectly solid there."},
{"comment": "Maybe the instructions aren't the easiest in the world, mainly because they make it all sound more difficult than it is to put the frame together and attach it to a wall. Assembling the frame is easy, attaching the arms to the TV is easy and then clipping the TV onto the frame is easier still. I was expecting to have to wiggle and manouevre a bit but was amazed to see that it clipped on straight away."},
{"comment": "There are a few extras, like a spirit level, and decent-looking HDMI cable, a key ring with a light on it and a cleaning cloth. Presumably to keep the TV clean, but I will probably use it for my glasses. The only thing I don't like is that there are two strings hanging down with little handles on. These are for releasing the lock if you want to dismount the TV and I do worry that kids might pull them. It should be easy enough to just hook them over the frame or use blu-tack to hold them out of the way."},
{"comment": "Given that this works perfectly well, I really can't see why people are spending upwards of 10 times the cost of this for other brackets. I paid for next day delivery and it was still cheaper than the cheapest bracket in Argos or Currys. If I ever decide to wall mount the downstairs TV I will absolutely get another of these."},
{"comment": "I've never wall mounted a T.V before, but my friend recommended this bracket to mount my 50 inch Bravia."},
{"comment": "It pretty much comes with everything you need, I had to buy some specific fixings for plaster board. (I used \"grip it\" fixings, which were fairly good) The bracket seems very good quality and overall does an excellent job. Once fitted, the T.V is easy to take off the bracket if needed."},
{"comment": "My only slight criticism is this: the mounts that attach to the T.V itself, do not seem to sit perfectly level when screwed in at the top holes of each mount. The T.V did not sit level despite both mount holes being in exactly the same position on each mount. I checked the wall mount with a spirit level and this was perfectly level. I did the same with the back of the T.V and it was definitely off. Thankfully, due to the design of the bracket, it was fairly easy to just adjust the mounts on the T.V and offset them very slightly to get it level. Not a massive problem, but slightly annoying."},
{"comment": "Edit:"},
{"comment": "I recently received an email from SPN imports, the company who supplied me with the bracket."},
{"comment": "They wrote to me regarding my feedback in having difficultly getting the TV mount level. They apologised, gave me a full refund and sent me a free gift of an articulating TV wall mount! They did all this despite me not having even contacting them to complain or anything. I think they had just seen my comments in my review. It was only a minor inconvenience anyway, I easily mounted the TV correctly, as stated in my review."},
{"comment": "I'm absolutely astounded at this level of customer care and full praise must be given, especially considering that I bought the mount back in march and they had actually taken consideration to follow the matter up some months later. They seemed genuinely concerned. So, thank you very much SPN imports, you are truly excellent and I appreciate your care! (I've changed my rating of the product from 4 stars to 5, for the excellent customer care received)"},
{"comment": "I then did a full height measurement of the TV, and held the tape measure open to that point above the dresser, and ultimately decided on 12\" from dresser top to TV bottom as my chosen height (made sure there was about that much space above TV top as well). Marked the bottom of TV on the wall, measured up from there the distance measured earlier from center of mount to bottom of TV, and marked the mount center point on the wall. I then held the mount at that center point, and used a laser level to line up the bolt holes on the stud centers I marked earlier. USed the included magnetic level to level the mount, marked the exact bolt holes positions, drilled pilot holes into the studs (instructions said to use 5mm (1/5\" - odd size) drill bit. I checked some size guides online and settled on 3/16\" which is a bit smaller. Bolted the mount to the wall, unscrewed the locking screws on bottom of the TV mount (you MUST do this before trying to hang the TV on the mount - they will block the bottom hooks from latching onto the bar unless they are backed out all the way flush), hung the TV, and locked it in with those bottom screws."},
{"comment": "I did have an issue with my mount missing 4 parts - 2 of the 4 horizontal bars and the 2 joining plates that connect those 4 bars to the center plate. It was odd - the empty plastic bags that would have held these parts were in the package.  The rest of the hardware bags were intact and unopened. My guess is they were not missing from the factory, but disappeared somewhere between there and my door. Why or how is a mystery."},
{"comment": "I called the manufacturer's number on the manual (On a weekend), and told them the model number of the mount (PILFK), and the part numbers from the manual's parts list, and they sent replacement, which arrived Thursday. Customer Service was great!"},
{"comment": "I am so glad I got this, no more tilting the TV up and wedging my hand to mess with wires, just pull it out and easy access. Mounting is very simple too. And way cheaper here than BestBuy and Costco. If your looking and debating go with it, you wont be disappointed. Several of my friends have gotten one and replaced theirs after seeing mine."},

{"comment": "I have bought a few mounts from this brand now. They're super easy and sturdy. Not much to it, easy install. Only thing with this mount it was missing one type of nut for the back of the TV. Luckily had the box from a previous mount and found what I was looking for in there."},

{"comment": "Packaging is minimal. Nothing flashy just a cardboard box. For its price, the build quality is very sturdy."},
{"comment": "Only bad thing about this mount is that it makes the TV ports somewhat hard to access. If the TV ports are on the back I don't think this mount would suit your needs. There's enough room to get them into the side, but you need to fiddle with it. I personally had to pull out one side of the TV to plug the HDMI cable in, but my hands are fairly big and the TV ports were sunken in quite a bit."},

{"comment": "Moving to the new TV was as issue though as the set required holds at 30cm centres which isn\u2019t possible out of the box which  was annoying, it was easily sorted with an angle grinder and drill - is just a shame to have to hack it about for such a popular band."},

The weight all on one side puts the TV off level and one end of the TV dipped lower.  I just had to re-mount on an angle to compensate for my un-eaven weight distribution. Understandable.

{"comment": "La presentaci\u00f3n del producto es muy buena, viene con un cable HDMI de buena calidad y un nivel que a pesar de ser peque\u00f1o es preciso y pr\u00e1ctico. La calidad del soporte es buena, se aprecia muy firme y resistente, desde luego el soporte no va a romper, antes te cargas la pared que el soporte. Incluye unos tornillos grandes para sujetar firmemente el soporte a la pared, aunque yo prefer\u00ed comprar unos de acero un poco m\u00e1s largos con unos tacos de m\u00e1s calidad para asegurar que la sujeci\u00f3n es a prueba de \"alto tonelaje\".  La TV que colgu\u00e9 es una LG de 42 pulgadas 3D con un peso oficial de 16 kilos. Este soporte aguanta 25 kilos, estoy convencido de que soportar\u00eda incluso m\u00e1s, pero el problema no est\u00e1 en los kilos que soporta sino en lo que cede el material por ese peso. Mi TV con 16 kilos est\u00e1 en el limite ya que, si quieres tener el soporte plegado,  la tuerca de sujeci\u00f3n de la TV chocar\u00eda con el brazo inferior debido al peso. Con los 16 kilos de mi TV la tuerca pasa por los pelos, con 17 kilos ya chocar\u00eda, no obstante si vas a tener el soporte algo desplegado ese detalle te dar\u00e1 igual."},
{"comment": "Otro detalle pecualiar es la pieza que sujeta la TV y el brazo, para regular la inclinaci\u00f3n se recurre a tres tuercas que regulan la posici\u00f3n de una esfera que hace las veces de pivote. El sistema es lento de regular y las tuercas est\u00e1n duras, pero es cierto que garantiza la estabilidad, otros soportescon el tiempo se aflojan, este sin embargo jam\u00e1s lo har\u00e1.  Peeeero, hay un fallo... La TV no solo se puede regular hacia arriba y hacia abajo, tambi\u00e9n se puede regular en inclinaci\u00f3n, para que quede horizontal. Por un lado esta posibilidad es muy pr\u00e1ctica porque muchos soportes no pueden hacerlo y en caso de habrer puesto la sujeci\u00f3n a la pared algo torcido siempre podr\u00e1s contrarrestarlo con esta regulaci\u00f3n pero el tornillo que regula esta funci\u00f3n esta por la parte anterior del soporte, es decir que hay que apretarlo ANTES de colocarlo sobre la TV porque luego no hay acceso, as\u00ed que puede ser algo tedioso."},

{"comment": "Soddisfatto dell'acquisto!"},
{"comment": "Ordered it a while ago in good faith but when this very heavy bracket arrived, there were no workable instructions with it and lots of different brackets and screws etc. I tried to fit it to the TV myself but failed, so I have since had two highly competent DIY people out and they cannot fathom how to assemble this bracket either. Even if you manage to fit it accross the back of the TV, in doing so you totally block access to the Ariel/ SCART socket rendering the TV useless. I haven't returned it yet partly because it was only \u00a320 and because of the weight of it I am sure it will cost far more than this to post it back."},
{"comment": "This Full Motion Articulating TV Wall Mount Bracket holds up my 70\" LG TV with no issues.  Was fairly easy to install.  The only challenge I am having is keeping the tilt at a certain angle... I have tried tightening it several times, however, every once in a while it tilts down."},

{"comment": "En resumen, por su precio no se puede pedir m\u00e1s. La clave est\u00e1 en el peso que le vayas a meter (hasta 16 kilos sin problema, con m\u00e1s no podr\u00e1s plegarlo completamente) y en el tipo de pared al que vayas a atornillar (con ladrillo mejor usar tacos de m\u00e1s calidad que los suministrados y tornillos m\u00e1s largos para que la sujeci\u00f3n sea en al menos en dos capas del ladrillo)."},
{"comment": "Terrific price, Well made and substantial. I did use a couple of extra fixing bolts not because I was worried about the mount but because my house is quite old and I wanted to make quite sure the fixings in the brickwork were secure."},
{"comment": "I liked the the swivel adjustment (which a lot of mounts do not have). Some times all your measurements can be correct yet when the TV is on the wall it can look slightly out horizontally, the adjustment  may only be a few degrees  but can make all the difference."},
{"comment": "The mount also has a tilt function which was a godsend for me. My TV is an LG E6 with passive 3D and for this to work properly you have to sit perpendicular to the TV so if sat on a couch and the tv is on a wall above your eye level the TV must point down towards you or else you will get blurred pictures when in 3D mode."},
{"comment": "I was puzzled why a level and HDMI had been included both were of low quality and unnecessary."},
{"comment": "All in a good purchase."},
{"comment": "Excellent quality, heavy duty mount. Delivery to rural Nova Scotia was two days from time of order as promised. The included HDMI cable is excellent quality, however the 'comedy' spirit level is next to useless."},
{"comment": "Some other reviewers complained that the mount sags with larger TV's, however I found the mount to be very stiff with no sag at all with the 38lb LG combined LCD TV/DVD player I mounted. The mount fixes easily between standard 16\" o/c studs, with an inch or so of 'wiggle room'. The tilt is OK, and the swivel action is great. It can position the TV reasonably flat against the wall, but still extend out 10\" or so, and offer a good range of left/right pan motion. The movement is very stiff, but I am sure it will loosen up after a while, however it may then sag, so I guess stiff is good."},
{"comment": "Other than the toy spirit level, my only complaint would be that the washers & screws provided with the TV mounting hardware could do with some more thought. The VESA mount on my TV used the smallest thread screws provided. Unfortunately the screw heads are the same size as the hole in the washers, so they are next to useless. I has some smaller washers hanging around, so it was an easy fix, but its something that should have been caught in the design/manufacture process."},
{"comment": "Overall, this is a decent quality, heavy duty mount with quite a good amount of movement. For the price, its a bargain."},
{"comment": "UPDATE"},
{"comment": "I was contacted by the manufacturer of the mount. They had actually taken the time to read the review, and were concerned that I had issues with the screws, the spirit level and the stiffness of the mount. They spent some time discussing the issues, in particular the screws, and assured me that my concerns would be passed on to the quality control department. They followed up with an email that also contained instructions on how to reduce the stiffness in the mount (I was happy that it was stiff). To top it all off, they gave me a $15 refund."},
{"comment": "Basically, for a manufacturer of what I consider to be a quality product to contact a customer and discuss and address their concerns is way over and above the service I would have expected. The $15 refund was the icing on the cake, especially considering I gave what I thought was already a pretty positive review. Did this influence my decision to update my review? Damn right it did. But the fact they followed up at all would have prompted me to update the review anyway."},
{"comment": "So, to sum this up. This is a quality product that was let down by a minor issue with screw / washer sizes. However, the customer service provided by the company is outstanding, more than making up for the minor issue. I have therefore changed my rating from 4 stars to five."},
{"comment": "If you are looking for a quality TV mount that is backed up by a quality company that really does care about its customers and products, then this mount is the one for you."},
{"comment": "Outstanding!!! I needed a wall bracket for a new TV. Was really pleased with the bracket itself. Sturdy and secure. Very good value. Now on top of that I got a very good quality HDMI cable. So good I want to buy another one as it is better than my previous expensive cables, it came included with the bracket. Also a spirit level to make sure it's all lined up neat!! And a cleaning cloth for the TV AND an really cool little led keyring light. I would highly recommend the company who made it. It just shows that there are companies around that do care about decent quality at an affordable price. This is not a paid review I want to add. Also I was not given any discount for it. I was just really impressed with everything so I wanted to leave a review so that other people can get one."},
{"comment": "This mount has a great number of features but unfortunately a lot of those features also work against it!"},
{"comment": "First of all, this mount is very low profile meaning that your TV is sitting VERY close to the wall and because of this it is impossible to use the rear HDMI inputs as there is not enough space between the back of the TV and the wall for the HDMI cable to plug in. The only way round this is to buy additional 90 degree cable adaptors to allow the cable input to point straight down."},
{"comment": "Secondly, although this mount has a 15 degree downward \"tilt\" facility, the fact that the mount is again so close to the wall means that the tilt cannot be utilised on a larger screen TV as bottom of the TV hits the wall before the tilt can kick in."},
{"comment": "So basically with my TV, an LG 55\", this mount can only be used \"flat\" against the wall after purchasing 90 degree HDMI adapters."},
{"comment": "However, this mount comes with a HUGE range of mounting options and can even be assembled \"half-size\" for smaller TV's so I would imagine it would be a very versatile mount for a smaller screen TV. Compared to similar mounts the sub-\u00a320 price is also great value."},
{"comment": "The mount comes with a FREE spirit level and also a very high quality HDMI cable."},
{"comment": "After 4 months of this mount I am now swapping it for a cantilever style so that I can get the TV a bit further away from the wall and utilise the rear HDMI connections as well as enable a downward tilt."},

Item has arrived 2 days later extremely happy with the  new product. Out of this world service, I would give them 1000 stars if I could."},

Most of the time we just use the TV\u2019s speakers, but also have an amp and outdoor speakers for when we have company over and want it louder."},
{"comment": "I bought this for our lanai in Florida. Luckily, I had a good friend, who is good at this kind of work, set it up for us.  However, I never knew that this was for wall mount, ONLY.  Our friend said \"veranda\" meant it had to go on the wall. There is no where in the specifications does it say it is ONLY wall-mounted. I had intended on having it sit on a tv table we have for the tv we had.  So, our friend went out and found a perfect stand that holds the tv as a wall mount, but is sitting on the table.  He found it at WalMart for around $60.  It is the \" ONN Swivel TV base, that fits most 32-65\" flat panel tvs up to 77 pounds.\"..Just make sure you attach your HDMI cables before attaching it .  to the stand, as the cables mount inside the door on the back of the tv, which will, then, be obstructed by the stand.  Looks great, all the way around!  Well, I'm editing my comment.  The sound is WAY too low.  I  set it to 100, the highest. Still, way too low. My husband is hard of hearing, and wears hearing aids. He still can't hear it.  It can't be heard at all when we are in the pool, only about 25 feet away. I have a decibel meter that I bought for another use. The tv meaured 56 decibels when the meter was only 3 feet away!  Looked up what conversation decibels are...60 decibels. So, this does not even broadcast a decibel level to the normal hearing level. For the price, it should be able to be blasted to next door!  I thought of the sound bar (another  $150.00 or so) but as it is depended on the sound from the tv, it will not work. Don't know if there is separate input jack for a separately controlled sound bar. To find that out, I will have to completely remove the tv from the stand to open the door (and I am 79 years old!), which is not an option for me.  Is there an option I can do to get the sound on this tv loud enough to even hear?  I hope the seller will let me know.  I can't even return as my installer removed all the packing material when he left. Otherwise, I certainly would. In the reviews, I never though I would have an issue with the sound...never.  Because of the sound issue, I am reducing my review to TWO stars.  I found another auxiliary speaker, that is for indoors, and will try to see if it fits.  If it does, fine. However, I think the manufacturer needs to take this sound issue very seriously. I wrote to the at their site, but, have yet to hear from them. If you read all this, I hope it is helpful."},

{"comment": "This cover adequately does what I need it to do. I like the front flap that can be rolled up to view TV without removing the cover, and I like that it also covers the back of the TV. Not hard to install, but also not really that easy to get it just how you wanted. Looks okay installed but is a little over-sized. I DID purchase the correct size for my 40\" TV, but it is still bigger than I wold prefer for aesthetics. Based on their measurement guide, the next one down in size (which indicated for a 40\" diagonal TV) would have not been wide enough by about three inches. I DID experience on day 1 a quality issue that I read others have experienced also. The stitching for the Velcro along the side of the bottom flap has already broken and about 3/4\" of the Velcro separated from the cover. Since it is a hidden area, I just stuck a staple through it to prevent it from getting worse. Not worth the trouble of returning the cover. I kind of question the use of the terms describing the cover as \"weatherproof\" and \"dust-proof,\" but then when you receive the cover the package says that it is \"water-resistant.\" Now, the description online does not say it is WATERPROOF, it just says it is WEATHERPROOF. Maybe I'm nit-picking, but since water is what I'm the most concerned about in protecting my TV, I see rain as the number one \"weather\" concern. So it claims to be weatherproof, but is only water-resistant. \"Proof\" and \"resistant\" are two different things, so this to me is misleading. Since my TV is mounted under the eave of the house outside on my deck, it is not exposed directly to the rain and I expect that this cover will work just fine for my needs. But, I would be wary of it if my TV was going to be completely exposed to the elements. Time will tell what the quality of this cover really is, but I'm satisfied at this point. But, the manufacturer apparently need to fix their \"double-stitching\" as this seems to be a common complaint."},
{"comment": "The 48-inch cover fits my 55-inch LG TV perfectly. The cover is about 1/2\" shorter than the TV width, so it's a snug fit.  Previously tried the 55-inch and 52-inch sizes, but they were oversized.  Also liked the velcro sealed seams in back to adjust for wiring and mounting bracket."},
{"comment": "Great outdoor cover, nice fit for our 55\" sceptre.  Worked well with Mounting Dream full motion wall mount we bought as well.  Really looking forward to the summer and being able to have this as an entertainment option by the pool.  I really like the front flap as well.  Saves from having to take it all the way off.  Will just need to make sure it doesn't get too hot behind the TV."},

{"comment": "I like the cover alot, I have a 55 inch TV and it covers the entire tv, also the  back of the cover have pockets as well, the only thing is if I want to keep the cover on and watch tv I have to split the velcro in the back of the tv so the vents can breathe."},

{"comment": "This is a well engineered, high quality TV mount.  The metal parts move smoothly, have no play and the powder black finish looks nice.  I was impressed with the quality and ease of installation. You can set the swing arm tension so there is a smooth and even resistance, and the TV stays put.  One important detail that every DIY installer would want to know is, how do I connect the TV to the wall bracket, or do I put it all together (TV and all) then try to mount it on the wall?  Do I need a buddy to hold up the whole thing for the final install?  Surprisingly this detail is missing from most product descriptions.  This one at least, you can install easily by yourself, because the backing plate which screws on to the back of your TV, will slide in easily and hang securely from the wall bracket arm.  You can then install the screws to secure the connection.  You don't need to hold up the TV end while you do this.  It's quite well thought out."},
{"comment": "Amazon is the man! This is a quality wall mount for a great price! I was worried it might be cheap or feel inadequate. No dice! This thing is legit. It is fully articulated, so it moves in just about any way you'd want up/down, side/side, tilt, it provides plenty of viewing angles. It is also very well built. It is solid metal with heavy duty hinges. It's not messing around, this mount means business. Installation was relatively painless, it does help to have a second person for when you are trying to center/level the mount, and the step of hanging the TV, but one person could definitely swing it if you were feeling frisky. Don't be scared by the price. This is not junk. It isn't going to break the first time you look at the TV funny. It's a serious wall mount for an unbeatable price."},
{"comment": "Great purchase.  Would buy again.  In fact I am going to buy another one."},
{"comment": "First of all, at less than $25, this is a steal compared to other wall mounts at retail stores and other online sellers."},
{"comment": "Second, super easy installation.  It took me about an hour and fifteen minutes.  But it only took me that long because I'm a neat freak, super anal, and neurotic about putting holes in my wall.  And also because no one would answer my calls or texts when I called for help attaching my 43 inch TV to the mounted bracket.  I had to jury rig a ladder and grow a third arm to do it myself.  My friends are bums."},
{"comment": "I'm deducting half a star because I don't like the way the cover attaches to the wall portion of the bracket.  As far as I can figure, it doesn't snap into place.  It just hangs there.  It looks fine when you carefully cover the arm with the cover, but since it doesn't snap into place it comes right off when you move the arm.  I'll have to get some double sided tape."},

{"comment": "Pessima esperienza."},

These are pretty thin and light compared to the other components of the bracket assembly. They bend and torque quite easily under the 35 kg TV. This results in a very wobbly TV whenever it's moved, ruining the feel of what would otherwise be a very sturdy bracket"},

{"comment": "Moving to the new TV was as issue though as the set required holds at 30cm centres which isn\u2019t possible out of the box which  was annoying, it was easily sorted with an angle grinder and drill - is just a shame to have to hack it about for such a popular band."},
{"comment": "Once the bracket was on the wall and the mount on the TV, attaching them was easy and I did so single handed with ease despite the size and inability to see the back thanks to the neat locating solution."},
{"comment": "The bracket gives a great deal of movement and is ideal for my room as I wanted the option to push flat to the wall or out into the corner depending on the presence of guests.  The design also makes it easy to route cables neatly along the arm from the wall to the TV, I\u2019ve got the power and 3x HDMI cables without any issue."},
{"comment": "All in all, I\u2019d highly recommend it, especially for the price - just be warned, it\u2019s not suitable for 30cm centre holes unless you\u2019re prepared to modify it (hence the four stars rather than five)."},

{"comment": "Over the widest arc of the articulated arm's travel, there is very little variation - millimetres - in the resting vertical/inclination angles of a large screen at different viewing points.

Even if you manage to fit it accross the back of the TV, in doing so you totally block access to the Ariel/ SCART socket rendering the TV useless. I haven't returned it yet partly because it was only \u00a320 and because of the weight of it I am sure it will cost far more than this to post it back."},

{"comment": "This thing is hands down the easiest contraption I have ever had to install. Simple design and multiple configuration options made it quick and easy to setup. We went through two flatscreens inside of six months (thank you unsupervised children - for which I accept full responsibility) and both were setup on their stands on top of the entertainment cabinet. We waited nearly a year before finally buying the bullet and purchasing a new one (they\u2019re stupid cheap these days, so it made sense to go for it). This time we decided to wall mount it and higher up with a tilt screen to add a little bit of protection. We bought a 55\u201d 4K TCL (gorgeous picture and I would definitely recommend if you\u2019re on a budget) and the mount arrived just a day before, so I had plenty of time to get it set and ready to go. Turns out all I needed was about 10 minutes to locate the wall studs, level, mark and drill pilot holes, and hang the frame. After that the only somewhat difficult part was loosening and tightening down the bolts for the tilt after I\u2019d gotten the rails attached to the TV. That, and figuring out how to store the cords for the springs that lock the rails in place. All in all, if you\u2019re looking for something that is quick and easy to install, but also secure as can be, this is a great choice."},
{"comment": "Price to quality ratio is excellent and even comes with a HDMI cable. Basic wall mount. No extra features like tilt possibility, but straight forward to install and does the job. I used it for my 49\u201d curved TV and it worked like a charm. The TV brackets barely made it and should be made a little longer. Also, the bubble level liquid is too dark, which makes it hard to see where the bubble is. Had to use another one I had and used my own hardware. Overall it\u2019s worth the price."},
{"comment": "My husband was worried it would be too flimsy as the metal isn't super thick or stiff when you hold it in your hand but we gave it a whirl and it's been holding our 70\" Vizio perfectly for the last couple months so I think it's a good deal"},

{"comment": "What I didn't like, is that the shelf feels a bit flimsy. I trust my stuff on it, but wouldn't like to see someone bump into it too hard. It feels as if the tempered glass is too heavy for the mounting center. The wire organizing tracks on both side don't seem to be able to hold many wires either."},

I was able to mount this into my wall with the hardware included..no extra hardware required..but you will need masonry drill bits and a drill to get the job done."},
{"comment": "The instruction manual is actually helpful! Step 1 clearly says to use 1/8\" drill bit to make long enough hole. I wish every set of instructions specified the size of the drill bit. It's so nice not have to guess at the instructions. The 3 shelves can actually be installed as 2 shelf and 1 shelf if needed, and it's pretty clear to do so without the instructions. Once all the screws are tightened, the shelves are snug, no wobble. I haven't put anything too heavy, just cable box, modem, router, and a laptop, across all three shelves."},

{"comment": "This mount is great for the price. Assembly of the mount is a little questionable because of the four tiny nuts used to screw everything together. I used an impact driver to tighten the bolts and the frame of the mount ended up slightly bent and folding outwards. Once installed, the frame was not flush on one side by a fraction of a millimeter. Still solid on the wall, but I went ahead and hung my 50 inch plasma TV on the mount. Once hung, the TV was solid. I love the easy release clips on the bottom of the mount instead of the use of screws. Getting to these screws on other mounts are a pain especially since tightening the bottom screws is done when the TV is hanging on the wall. Sometimes there isn't much room to move around."},
{"comment": "My mount was only slightly off on the wall in terms of being level, but the screws at the top of the mount fixed that.  A couple of turns on one screw and my TV was level even though my mount wasn't perfect. Fantastic idea that my other two mounts in my house do not have."},
{"comment": "This was simple to assemble and came with several mounting options both for drywall, stud-mounting and even on concrete or brick walls. It offers a lot of adjustability and even has micro-adjustment screws in case your wall mount isn\u2019t perfectly level. A very well thought out product."},
{"comment": "Used this to hang up an 82 inch Samsung. It is well built and easy to install, came with all hardware needed and a hole guide to help. The price is very good for a mount this size and my TV is securely up on the wall. I would reccomend this mount."},
{"comment": "Love that our TV is now hanging!! Very sturdy. We have a 70\u201d TV. Love that it tilts and aligns a little. Brother helped me install it and said it was pretty easy. Only thing we didn\u2019t like was that the measurements in the instructions aren\u2019t in inches or centimeters but are in millimeters. And I also love the price compared to buying in a store or major retailer! Thank you!"},

{"comment": "I didn\u2019t actually install this. I returned it to Amazon. I bought it thinking this is what I needed, but came to find I needed a single stud mount instead due to the stud locations in my wall. This mount seemed really simple and I\u2019m sure would\u2019ve worked well."},

{"comment": "The system is very easy to install, very sturdy. You can adjust it to pretty much any size sound bar. The only complaint I have is the wall anchors...they are huge. Way too big for the system. they are 2 inch wall anchors, when you really don't need anything that size. I ended up having to use some spare 1 inch wall anchors I had and screws to make sure it sat properly."},

{"comment": "This worked out great for our standard sound bar. You do need an extension drill bit for install. Other than that, it was easy to install and it looks great."},
{"comment": "First off i am super happy that this came with all the necessary hardware and even a level to make sure its straight, only thing i disliked is that my soundbar was not thick enough to be retained, i just simply used a small peice of wood for the gap difference, besides that this works perfect."},
{"comment": "Overall, the mount is good. It has a clean look and is easy to install. It's a good thing it's easy to install, because there are no instructions included in the box... at all. For people that have installed an anchor into drywall before, it's not a problem, if you haven't though, you might have a hard time trying to figure out what to do. The screws are a brass color and the bracket is black, so if that aesthetic isn't something you're ok with, then you're in luck because you're going to want to get your own screws. The anchor screw combo that's included simply didn't work. The screws are too short to fit though the bracket and into the anchor far enough to engage it. The anchors never popped open inside the wall either, so the screws just kept spinning and left the brackets loosely attached to the wall since they never bit in. If available, attach the brackets directly to studs, that'll provide a much sturdier install and you won't have to worry about anchors."},
{"comment": "The brackets are unique but they fit our Samsung sound bar perfectly. The hardware is heavy duty, and very secure. Would recommend/"},
{"comment": "They drywall anchors that came with the mount were absolutely useless, kind of like they had had screws run through them previously.  When I got it installed and went to tighten the brackets that clamp the sound bar the screw that you are supposed to tighten fell out of the housing.  I am sure it is a great mount when sent a new one."},
{"comment": "I knew when I opened the package and saw plastic wall anchors with slight expansion from the supplied screws these wouldn't work.  But went ahead and drilled out (even slightly undersized) the drywall holes for the plastic anchors - mind you the sound bar was a small one (ROKU) so not asking for much weight. Went to screw the brackets into these anchors and at the end of everyone of the 4 holes, the plastic anchor started turning in place.  I will replace these with Molly Bolts or more suitable hardware, but to sell this kit is ridiculous and I am sorry I wasted my time thinking these plastic anchors would hold. Not even one!"},
{"comment": "These are very sturdy and their design makes them compatible with most soundbars.  They can be adjusted for thickness of the soundbar and length.  There's no tricky measurements necessary to get them in the exact right place to match up to mounts on the soundbar since they hold it from the bottom and two sides.  There are holes on the back bracket if you want or need to also use screws to secure your soundbar, however I chose not to use them."},

(I didn't even know they were included) don't need either, but my daughter loves the level(it has blue bubbles) anyway I have mounted about 15 or 20 tvs on walls. Usually use the mounts from Walmart/best buy. Sanus /ONN brands. They have all dropped in price the last few years. Used to be about $60  to $100 depending on the size TV. And as far as the one review goes that has a complaint (with a Pic) saying \"cheap plastic anchors drilled 3/8th inch holes per derections) or something like that. And he now has to tear out the anchors and buy new bolts"},
{"comment": ". All he had to do is use the washers, or the spacers from T9 or T10 (seen in photo of included hardware) anyway, if you buy this you won't be disappointed. I forgot to mention Pic 1.those little keyring lookin things attached to strings, are such a nice touch. (of course they will be hidden after the final install) but if you are familiar with wall mounting tvs and need to make a slight adjustment, like take the TV back off. Then you know how hard it is to get to the little lever things to release. All you have to do with this one is pull those keyring looking things. Bravo nice touch."},

{"comment": "When I first started looking at mounts for my 70 pound, 65 inch TV, I got a little sticker shocked. I was not ready to spend $100+ to mount my TV. The manufacturer recommended mount actually ran higher than that, close to $150. When I found this mount, I was a little skeptical. How can something so cheap work as well as the $150 recommended mount? By God, was I wrong. If you have a bunch of money to waste, then go ahead and buy the more expensive ones. If you're looking for a great mount that is easy to assemble and doesn't cost a fortune, head this way. We actually had to mount this thing twice (because I tried to go too quick and the thing was no where near level) but we were still done within an hour!"},

And my 65 in tv is safe and very sturdy. Would highly recommend and will be buying more for every tv I get."},
{"comment": "This mount is definitely the best bang for your buck! I used it in our master bedroom, and was very pleased. The studs in our wall are offsetted, and it is a very small wall so with previous mounts we could never get the TV centered the way we'd like it but with this mounts extension peice it has allowed us to not only perfectly center our television - but also upgrade the size to perfectly fit as well! The kit came with a little cutout stencil for you can test out where you need to drill, and also as your drilling there is a magnetic level which came in super handy since I mounted this to the wall single handedly, and couldn't hold the level myself. I'm super happy with this purchase and would totally recommend and even buy again for the next time I need to mount."},

Lots of different hardware for all makes of tvs and the metal wasn't flimsy at all. I installed this on a piece of 3/8 plywood cut 2 inches larger in diameter then the mount with the attachment on each for more rigidity when mounting bracket.  As you can see it holds up the tv nicely (70'' Sony) and the tilt range is perfect for what i was looking for. Definitely recommend if you want a setup like mine."},

{"comment": "At first I thought this was a very high price for two steel wall brackets, but when I got to installing them I realized they were totally worth every penny I paid for them. What makes these simple wall brackets so great is the way they have designed and the installation template that is included. The brackets are designed to be mounted 16\" apart (the normal spacing of studs in a wall). Included is a template that you scotch tape to the wall, so all you do is mark the holes, drill and install the brackets. The template shows the exact size of the Sound Bar so you can look at where you want to place the device before you actually install it. It is simple and the finished installation is excellent and extremely sturdy."},

Seller (Bose's online partner) must understand  that only a bubble wrapper envelope is not sufficient to courier these heavy metal strips, as these required much more shock absorbing packaging materials to prevent from transit damages. They should have spend at least INR 10 to 50 more for packaging purpose."},

{"comment": "If you don't have a fireplace this is an awesome substitute. The color of the wood is great and looks good and was designed with decent wood. The fireplace allows for only light for those hot days where heat is not desired. Then for those cold nights you can turn heat and light on at same time. However, if you only want the heat source that's an option as well without fireplace light maybe while watching a movie. The only reason why I have it a 4 star is the stickers to cover up screws. You get about 20 stickers that are suppose to cover up all screw holes, but they don't stick and mine fell off on all except a few. Overall, I would still recommend if you are looking for dresser for TV or whatever you choose."},

{"comment": "As someone who has owned fake flame electric fireplaces in the past, here's what I don't like about this particular item.  It has no remote to turn the fireplace on and off, adjust brightness, flame speed, etc. (most other fake fireplaces come with a remote, especially for the price of this unit).  So....you can't adjust the speed or brightness of the flame.  If you want to run the fireplace, you have to just switch a button on the unit on or off and it has the most fake flames I've ever seen on a fake fireplace.  If you want the heater on, you have to switch that on with a separate switch.  Very basic ambiance with this thing.  I got around the remote on/off flame feature by plugging it into a remote outlet plug.  I rarely run the heater so that stays off.  Also, it came with a dent in the front of the right leg and the finish chipped off, but I was able to hide it with the black woodgrain adhesive dots that came with it.  I called Amazon and they credited me back some money for it since I was willing to keep it anyway.  Gotta love Amazon...and  I do!  Finally....it also arrived with 4 right pin hinges for the glass doors, instead of the 2 right, 2 left hinges it was supposed to come with.  So I haven't been able to install the glass doors.  Had to contact the manufacturer to request the proper hinges.  That was easy enough....until the hinges arrived today and they are antique copper finish.  My unit is black and has black hinges.  They sent the wrong color hinges. \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  They won't show when the doors are closed but in all honesty, this wall unit is not worth the price listed.  It took over 4 hours to assemble and I still have to assemble the doors - the hinges took a week to arrive. $150 tops would be a more reasonable price for this.  Just sayin.  Despite the obstacles, it looks decent so I'm keeping it; however, for the aforementioned reasons above, I'm only giving it 3 stars."},

Everything came intact  and it looks great."},
{"comment": "I gave 4 stars because I love the finished product. It looks great and seems sturdy enough. I had a couple of issues building it. First the bottom of it was cracked. It wasn't all the way through (just on the top layer) and was on the side towards the floor so I just put some wood glue over it. 2nd there were no predrilled holes for the screws that screw the fireplace insert in. You need to use a tiny drill bit to predrill them and it's impossible to put them in with out a long magnetic screw driver in that small cramped area. A man could not fit their hand in there.  Also, one of the hinge pieces had a little burr of metal barely sticking up inside it where the post part is attached to stick out the other side. This made it so the door could not slide into the hinge properly. I had to grind it down to be able to use it. Luckily I am pretty handy and have a lot of tools but a lot of people would not. It ended up looking great. I used some different knobs I had to match the rest of my furniture. Overall I am happy with it especially for the price point. It looks more expensive than it was but be prepared to take a few hours putting it together by yourself."},

The instructions were fairly good, however when it comes to the two flat pieces 18, before you slip the top two levels on, slide those down, and the stickers were hard to peel off, otherwise youll be taking it apart.

I\u2019m returning these and will continue looking for something sturdier."},
